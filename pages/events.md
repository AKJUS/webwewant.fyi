We’re traveling to conferences and meetups across the world to listen to your feedback. If you’re attending, you may get the opportunity to pitch us on why we (as a community) need to go solve a particular problem or deficiency you’ve encountered. The most compelling problems—as judged by a panel of experts and the audience—will win awesome prizes too!

At each event, we’ll provide enough time for a handful of people to present their "wants" to the audience. If yours is chosen, you’ll have about 5 minutes to make your pitch to the judges and the audience. You can do this live on stage or you can record your pitch and post it on YouTube (or similar). You can put together a pitch deck if you want or you can freestyle it; that’s up to you.
