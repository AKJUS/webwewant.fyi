If you build websites, you inevitably run into problems. Maybe there’s no way to achieve an aspect of your design using CSS. Or maybe there’s a device feature you really wish you could tap into using JavaScript. Or perhaps the in-browser DevTools don’t give you a key insight you need to do your job. We want to hear about it!

We started this project to collect your feedback about the current state of the web and to give you a voice to help shape what the future of web. To kick things off, we’re traveling to conferences and meetups across the world to give you a chance to pitch us on why we (as a community) need to go solve a particular problem or deficiency you’ve encountered in the web platform, developer tooling, or other areas. The most compelling problems—as judged by a panel of experts and the audience—will win awesome prizes too!
