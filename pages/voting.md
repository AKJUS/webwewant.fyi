Our voting system is a little different because we respect your privacy. We don’t want to require you to have an account on this site because (frankly) we have no interest in your personal information. We also want you to own your vote, so we opted to use [webmentions](https://indieweb.org/Webmention) as our voting system.

Votes are tallied from webmention <a href="https://indieweb.org/bookmark">“bookmarks”</a> and <a href="https://indieweb.org/like">“likes”</a> of each want’s page. These could be hand-crafted webmentions sent from your own site or shares and likes on social media. We are hopeful that this approach works well, but reserve the right to change or alter the voting process in the future if need be.
