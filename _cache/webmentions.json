Working on a solution? Digital accessibility should be a hard requirement. Full stop. If the ‚Äúsolution‚Äù isn‚Äôt accessible, then you haven‚Äôt found the solution yet. Keep working on it- you‚Äôll get there! Check out tools like <a href=\"https://assistivlabs.com/\">Assistiv Labs</a>, that might be able to help with cross-browser/platform testing.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Train</strong> to be a master. No one can do this overnight. Integrate training for all parts of your organization- hire experts to come in and provide training. Look for reputable online courses. Start adding in accessibility audits to code reviews and even consider making it a facet of annual employee reviews for developers that create code for the front-end. Change can be hard, but change starts with each one of us, and happens with every decision we make along the way.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Participate</strong> in the process. Submit your ideas and wants to <a href=\"https://webwewant.fyi/wants/\">The Web We Want</a> project. File issues with browsers and frameworks, and make it clear that you want this from them. When you figure out that an ARIA authoring practice doesn‚Äôt work in your app, <a href=\"https://github.com/w3c/aria-practices\">file an issue on GitHub</a>.</li>\n</ol><h2>Imagining the world of tomorrow</h2>\n<p>After the practical things to help us right now, though, we can turn our thoughts to the developer experience we imagine having in the future.</p>\n<p>I recently started a project called <a href=\"https://melsumner.gitbook.io/ember-component-patterns/\">ember-component-patterns</a>, which is specifically for Ember.js users but could be expanded for all frameworks. While still in its infancy, the project aims to take accessibility development one step further, by showing patterns, anti-patterns, ideas for styling, semantic HTML and how to turn all of that into an Ember component. There are too many bridges yet to build between the islands of JavaScript developers, web developers, designers, and anyone else involved in building digital products. I think this project will, at its completion, do its part to build a bridge or two. And maybe inspire a few more along the way.</p>\n<p>Another imagination- what about a command-line tool for developers to review their own sites in the same way a screen reader would? Think more like a text adventure game- only it‚Äôs a tool for making sure you haven‚Äôt inadvertently created a keyboard trap, or content that doesn‚Äôt get properly exposed because it lacks appropriate semantics. I like this idea because I think it could provide a bridge between users with assistive technology and JavaScript engineers who spend their time at the command line. Experiencing the frustrations of the user with assistive technology within the medium that the engineer is familiar with would be a new approach to helping software engineers become more aware of what their code needs to actually do from a technical perspective. Plus, I think this would be <em>really fun to use</em>.</p>\n<p>Finally- how could we better signal the intent of a piece of code, or part of a website? After all, successful digital accessibility is the capability to express intent in a machine-readable way, so that a developer‚Äôs code can be interpreted properly by the assistive technology. I don‚Äôt think we have the tools past semantic HTML &amp; ARIA right now, and I think some imagination and experimentation has an opportunity to thrive here. We can create custom components to do some very cool things, but we need a new way to describe the intent and purpose of them to assistive technology.</p>\n<h2>It could be amazing- we just have to decide</h2>\n<p>While it is probably more likely than not that accessibility may have to be forced on developers by browsers (and who knows what that solution would look like), I dearly hope that this is not the inevitable future of our industry. I hope that our tenacity and ingenuity, paired with our creativity and imagination, will lead us to a different place entirely. My hope is that we will be <strong><em>inspired</em></strong> to create the world we want to live in, create the tech that allows us to develop inclusive experiences in a way that is fun for us, and makes the digital world possible for those who need it.</p>\n<p>The digital future is inclusive for all kinds of users- there is no changing this or stopping it. It has already been decided and it is already happening. Those on the forefront of the what some would call the last frontier in tech are already showing us the way. While we could just wait to see what legal regulations and tech giants hand to us, <em>it doesn‚Äôt have to be that way</em>. <strong>We</strong> can create the tools that <em>we want</em> to use, that are fun to use, and that take us to the next level of web development.</p>\n<p>We can create the the tools of tomorrow that we really want. Let‚Äôs seize this opportunity and create something incredible.</p>",

After all, successful digital accessibility is the capability to express intent in a machine-readable way, so that a developer‚Äôs code can be interpreted properly by the assistive technology. I don‚Äôt think we have the tools past semantic HTML & ARIA right now, and I think some imagination and experimentation has an opportunity to thrive here. We can create custom components to do some very cool things, but we need a new way to describe the intent and purpose of them to assistive technology.\nIt could be amazing- we just have to decide\nWhile it is probably more likely than not that accessibility may have to be forced on developers by browsers (and who knows what that solution would look like), I dearly hope that this is not the inevitable future of our industry. I hope that our tenacity and ingenuity, paired with our creativity and imagination, will lead us to a different place entirely. My hope is that we will be inspired to create the world we want to live in, create the tech that allows us to develop inclusive experiences in a way that is fun for us, and makes the digital world possible for those who need it.\nThe digital future is inclusive for all kinds of users- there is no changing this or stopping it. It has already been decided and it is already happening. Those on the forefront of the what some would call the last frontier in tech are already showing us the way. While we could just wait to see what legal regulations and tech giants hand to us, it doesn‚Äôt have to be that way. We can create the tools that we want to use, that are fun to use, and that take us to the next level of web development.\nWe can create the the tools of tomorrow that we really want. Let‚Äôs seize this opportunity and create something incredible."

Example: <abbr title=\"User Experience/User Interface design. I just say 'design'.\">UX/UI design</abbr>.</p>\n<h2>My solution for semantic sidenotes</h2>\n<p>My solution for now is a combination of HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The HTML looks like this:</p>\n<pre><code>\n</code></pre><pre><code>1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n</code></pre><code>\n\n\n</code><pre><code><span></span>\n<span></span></code></pre><p><code></code></p><code> <span>Some</span> <span>sentence</span> <span>with</span> <span>a</span><span></span><span>span</span> <span>class=</span><span>\"sidenote sidenote--collapsed\"</span><span>&gt;</span>\n  <span><span></span> <span>class=</span><span>\"sidenote sidenote--collapsed\"</span><span>&gt;</span>\n    <span><span></span>\n      <span>class=</span><span>\"sidenote__button\"</span>\n      <span>tabindex=</span><span>\"0\"</span>\n      <span>title=</span><span>\"Here's the content of the sidenote.\"</span>\n      <span>onKeypress=</span><span>\"handleSidenoteKeypress(event)\"</span>\n      <span>onClick=</span><span>\"handleSidenoteButtonClick(event)\"</span><span>&gt;</span>\n        label\n      <span></span></span>\n    <span></span> <span>class=</span><span>\"sidenote__content\"</span><span>&gt;</span>\n      <span><span></span> <span>class=</span><span>\"sidenote__content-parenthesis\"</span><span>&gt;</span>\n        (sidenote:\n      <span></span></span>\n      Here's the content of the sidenote\n      <span><span></span> <span>class=</span><span>\"sidenote__content-parenthesis\"</span><span>&gt;</span>\n        )\n      <span></span></span>\n    <span></span>\n  <span></span></span>\nfor the sidenote.<span></span>\n\n\n</code><p><code></code></p><code></code><p>I wrap the whole thing in a span, <span><br /><span title=\"As a nice side effect, on large screens, where the sidenote appears next to the body text, both asterisks get hover styling when one either the content or the inline span has the mouse cursor over it.\">mainly</span><br /><br /><span> (sidenote: </span><br />\n    As a nice side effect, on large screens, where the sidenote appears next to the body text, both asterisks get hover styling when one either the content or the inline span has the mouse cursor over it.<br /><span>)</span><br /><br /></span><br />\n to keep the required JavaScript simple.</p>\n<p>Then there‚Äôs the inline phrase that gets the asterisk. The <code></code> tag would be perfect for it, but buttons are hidden by Safari and Firefox‚Äôs reader modes, leaving a gap in the sentence. With <code>tabindex=\"0\"</code> and some CSS, the thing seems to behave pretty much like a button. It has a <code>title</code> attribute, so the content is also shown on mouse hover.</p>\n<p>For the sidenote content I use the <code></code> element. <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/small\">MDN says</a> it was made for representing side comments and small print. So semantically that‚Äôs pretty good. It has an additional benefit: by default it should be rendered with a smaller font size. So even when CSS is not applied, like in my RSS reader, it should appear smaller.</p>\n<p>The spans with the class <code>sidenote__content-parenthesis</code> are hidden with CSS. They‚Äôre mainly there for screen readers. I found that when my iPhone reads my posts out loud, only adding parenthesis around the sidenotes is confusing. By adding the phrase ‚Äòsidenote: ‚Äò, it‚Äôs much clearer why the sentence is interrupted.</p>\n<p>The JavaScript I added is straightforward; it just toggles classes on the wrapper span <code>sidenote</code>:</p>\n<pre><code>\n</code></pre><pre><code>1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n</code></pre><code>\n\n\n</code><pre><code><span>function</span> <span>handleSidenoteButtonClick</span><span>(</span><span>e</span><span>){</span>\n  <span>const</span> <span>el</span><span>=</span><span>e</span><span>.</span><span>target</span><span>;</span>\n  <span>el</span><span>.</span><span>parentNode</span><span>.</span><span>classList</span><span>.</span><span>toggle</span><span>(</span><span>'</span><span>sidenote--expanded</span><span>'</span><span>);</span>\n  <span>el</span><span>.</span><span>parentNode</span><span>.</span><span>classList</span><span>.</span><span>toggle</span><span>(</span><span>'</span><span>sidenote--collapsed</span><span>'</span><span>);</span>\n  <span>el</span><span>.</span><span>blur</span><span>();</span>\n<span>}</span>\n\n<span>function</span> <span>handleSidenoteKeypress</span><span>(</span><span>e</span><span>){</span>\n  <span>if</span><span>(</span><span>e</span><span>.</span><span>key</span> <span>===</span> <span>'</span><span>Enter</span><span>'</span> <span>||</span> <span>e</span><span>.</span><span>key</span> <span>===</span> <span>'</span><span> </span><span>'</span><span>){</span>\n    <span>const</span> <span>el</span><span>=</span><span>e</span><span>.</span><span>target</span><span>;</span>\n    <span>e</span><span>.</span><span>preventDefault</span><span>();</span>\n    <span>el</span><span>.</span><span>parentNode</span><span>.</span><span>classList</span><span>.</span><span>toggle</span><span>(</span><span>'</span><span>sidenote--expanded</span><span>'</span><span>);</span>\n    <span>el</span><span>.</span><span>parentNode</span><span>.</span><span>classList</span><span>.</span><span>toggle</span><span>(</span><span>'</span><span>sidenote--collapsed</span><span>'</span><span>);</span>\n  <span>};</span>\n<span>}</span>\n</code></pre><code>\n\n</code><p><code></code></p><code></code><p>There‚Äôs a whole bunch of CSS to make the content appear in the right place, hide it by default on small screens and to add the asterisks. I‚Äôm not going to include all of it‚Äîuse the inspector of you‚Äôre interested. But it‚Äôs worth mentioning that just hiding the sidenote‚Äôs content with <code>display: none</code> causes it to be ignored by screen readers. So instead, I hide it like this:</p>\n<pre><code><span>.sidenote--collapsed</span> <span>.sidenote__content</span><span>,</span>\n<span>.sidenote__content-parenthesis</span><span>{</span>\n  <span>position</span><span>:</span> <span>absolute</span><span>;</span>\n  <span>left</span><span>:</span> <span>-99999px</span><span>;</span>\n  <span>top</span><span>:</span> <span>auto</span><span>;</span>\n<span>}</span></code></pre>\n<h2>Is this solution good enough?</h2>\n<p>The solution above looks good in the major browsers; when CSS is applied things look as intended. When CSS is not available, default styles make the everything look as intended. In that scenario, the content in the example code above would look like this: ‚Äú(sidenote: Here‚Äôs the content of the sidenote)‚Äù. No weird line breaks there. The only screen reader test I did was with iOS. It speaks the text just as intended, including the ‚Äòsidenote:‚Äô part of it (which is the reason I included that part, otherwise the sentences sound weird).</p>\n<p>For non-standard browsers, support is okay-ish. Firefox‚Äôs and Desktop Safari‚Äôs reader views do a fine job. It correctly renders the content within the <code></code> tags smaller. Same for The RSS reader I use, Reeder. Chrome‚Äôs <span><br /><span title=\"Jeez Chrome, how is this still experimental?!\">experimental</span><br /><br /><span> (sidenote: </span><br />\n    Jeez Chrome, how is this still experimental?!<br /><span>)</span><br /><br /></span><br />\n reader mode adds some superfluous linebreaks, but doesn‚Äôt remove any content. Mobile Safari‚Äôs reader view hides the sidenote content, but the button span remains, so there‚Äôs still a readable main article. Pocket however, just hides the whole <code>.sidenote</code> span‚Äîweird!</p>\n<p>The worst part of the solution is that requires CSS and JavaScript. There‚Äôs a lot of HTML. I guess it‚Äôs hard to add to CMSs. And it feels icky that the clickable part  has to be a <code><span></span></code>.</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>Arguably, I (and you) would be better off, If I tried to write more concisely. But beyond this blog, I think there‚Äôs a valid case to be made for sidenotes. They‚Äôve been around in print media for centuries. A better separation in the representation of main content and details can be useful in many areas. I think especially long form educational and journalistic content could benefit a lot from sidenotes.</p>\n<p>My solution is the result of several iterations with help from <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57272564/what-html-element-for-semantic-sidenotes/57304727#57304727\">StackOverflow</a> users. They did mention elements I hadn‚Äôt considered, but there‚Äôs no perfect solution just yet.</p>\n<p>So when I found out about the <span><br /><span title=\"It's [like a survey](https://webwewant.fyi/about/) for web devs to tell browser makers what they want.

The HTML looks like this:\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n\n\n\n\n Some sentence with aspan class=\"sidenote sidenote--collapsed\">\n   class=\"sidenote sidenote--collapsed\">\n    \n      class=\"sidenote__button\"\n      tabindex=\"0\"\n      title=\"Here's the content of the sidenote.\"\n      onKeypress=\"handleSidenoteKeypress(event)\"\n      onClick=\"handleSidenoteButtonClick(event)\">\n        label\n      \n     class=\"sidenote__content\">\n       class=\"sidenote__content-parenthesis\">\n        (sidenote:\n      \n      Here's the content of the sidenote\n       class=\"sidenote__content-parenthesis\">\n        )\n      \n    \n  \nfor the sidenote.\n\n\nI wrap the whole thing in a span, \nmainly\n\n (sidenote: \n\n    As a nice side effect, on large screens, where the sidenote appears next to the body text, both asterisks get hover styling when one either the content or the inline span has the mouse cursor over it.\n)\n\n\n\n to keep the required JavaScript simple.\nThen there‚Äôs the inline phrase that gets the asterisk. The  tag would be perfect for it, but buttons are hidden by Safari and Firefox‚Äôs reader modes, leaving a gap in the sentence. With tabindex=\"0\" and some CSS, the thing seems to behave pretty much like a button. It has a title attribute, so the content is also shown on mouse hover.\nFor the sidenote content I use the  element. MDN says it was made for representing side comments and small print. So semantically that‚Äôs pretty good. It has an additional benefit: by default it should be rendered with a smaller font size. So even when CSS is not applied, like in my RSS reader, it should appear smaller.\nThe spans with the class sidenote__content-parenthesis are hidden with CSS. They‚Äôre mainly there for screen readers. I found that when my iPhone reads my posts out loud, only adding parenthesis around the sidenotes is confusing. By adding the phrase ‚Äòsidenote: ‚Äò, it‚Äôs much clearer why the sentence is interrupted.\nThe JavaScript I added is straightforward; it just toggles classes on the wrapper span sidenote:\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n\n\n\nfunction handleSidenoteButtonClick(e){\n  const el=e.target;\n  el.parentNode.classList.toggle('sidenote--expanded');\n  el.parentNode.classList.toggle('sidenote--collapsed');\n  el.blur();\n}\n\nfunction handleSidenoteKeypress(e){\n  if(e.key === 'Enter' || e.key === ' '){\n    const el=e.target;\n    e.preventDefault();\n    el.parentNode.classList.toggle('sidenote--expanded');\n    el.parentNode.classList.toggle('sidenote--collapsed');\n  };\n}\n\n\nThere‚Äôs a whole bunch of CSS to make the content appear in the right place, hide it by default on small screens and to add the asterisks. I‚Äôm not going to include all of it‚Äîuse the inspector of you‚Äôre interested. But it‚Äôs worth mentioning that just hiding the sidenote‚Äôs content with display: none causes it to be ignored by screen readers. So instead, I hide it like this:\n.sidenote--collapsed .sidenote__content,\n.sidenote__content-parenthesis{\n  position: absolute;\n  left: -99999px;\n  top: auto;\n}\nIs this solution good enough?\nThe solution above looks good in the major browsers; when CSS is applied things look as intended. When CSS is not available, default styles make the everything look as intended. In that scenario, the content in the example code above would look like this: ‚Äú(sidenote: Here‚Äôs the content of the sidenote)‚Äù. No weird line breaks there. The only screen reader test I did was with iOS. It speaks the text just as intended, including the ‚Äòsidenote:‚Äô part of it (which is the reason I included that part, otherwise the sentences sound weird).\nFor non-standard browsers, support is okay-ish. Firefox‚Äôs and Desktop Safari‚Äôs reader views do a fine job. It correctly renders the content within the  tags smaller. Same for The RSS reader I use, Reeder. Chrome‚Äôs \nexperimental\n\n (sidenote: \n\n    Jeez Chrome, how is this still experimental?!\n)\n\n\n\n reader mode adds some superfluous linebreaks, but doesn‚Äôt remove any content. Mobile Safari‚Äôs reader view hides the sidenote content, but the button span remains, so there‚Äôs still a readable main article. Pocket however, just hides the whole .sidenote span‚Äîweird!\nThe worst part of the solution is that requires CSS and JavaScript. There‚Äôs a lot of HTML. I guess it‚Äôs hard to add to CMSs. And it feels icky that the clickable part  has to be a .\nConclusion\nArguably, I (and you) would be better off, If I tried to write more concisely. But beyond this blog, I think there‚Äôs a valid case to be made for sidenotes. They‚Äôve been around in print media for centuries. A better separation in the representation of main content and details can be useful in many areas. I think especially long form educational and journalistic content could benefit a lot from sidenotes.\nMy solution is the result of several iterations with help from StackOverflow users. They did mention elements I hadn‚Äôt considered, but there‚Äôs no perfect solution just yet.\nSo when I found out about the \nWeb We Want\n\n (sidenote: \n\n    It‚Äôs like a survey for web devs to tell browser makers what they want. Check it out, there are cool ideas there.\n)\n\n\n\n, I submitted this sidenotes problem. The team selected it to be presented at the Beyond Tellerrand conference and asked me to make a video about how I made sidenotes (a short version of this post). Their team was formed by the browser makers, so I‚Äôm pretty sure the proper semantic solution really doesn‚Äôt exist yet.\nYou think my solution for sidenotes is not great? Neither do I. Vote for I want semantic HTML sidenotes and one day there may be a more elegant way to do this!"

We want to be mindful that not everyone can attend conferences so if you your submission is selected and you indicate you‚Äôre not attending an event,you‚Äôll have an opportunity to record your lightning talk ahead of time and we‚Äôll include it in the live session. \nThe live session culminates with the judges deliberating and deciding on the most pressing ‚Äúwant‚Äù pitched during the session. We also have a community voting aspect that allows the event audience to rank what they think is the most pressing thing for browser vendors (or standards bodies) to work on. Even if you‚Äôre not attending an event, you can still vote for your favorite ‚Äúwants‚Äù on the website as well as by sharing them on social media. \nSo far we‚Äôve run sessions at An Event Apart DC, Smashing Conf, and View Source, and the community participation and panel discussion of wants has been fantastic. If you run a meetup or a conference and are interested in facilitating this session, reach out to Stephanie Stimac or Aaron Gustafson. \nThe Web We Want\nWe‚Äôre at a point in the web platform where browser vendors and standards bodies are eager to know what it is web developers and designers need in the platform. We need to know where to invest resources. Hop over to the Web We Want and let us know what you think the web platform needs so that we can shape the future of the web together. \nThe post Building the Web We Want appeared first on CSS-Tricks.\n\n\n\n\nSource link"

        "text": "Building the Web We Want \n                            \nOn the Microsoft Edge team, we‚Äôre committed to an open web and helping to drive innovation forward, which is why we‚Äôve kicked off a new initiative in collaboration with Google, Mozilla, Samsung Internet, Igalia and ‚Äî most importantly ‚Äî the web community, called The Web We Want.\nThe Web We Want is an open initiative for web developers and designers (or anyone who builds things for the web) to tell browser vendors what we should focus on building or fixing. The overarching question we‚Äôre asking is this: If you had a magic wand and could change anything about the web platform, what would it be? What are problems you‚Äôve encountered with the web that you need to hack around or what tools need to be improved or built to help you do your job better? What‚Äôs something you think you should be able to do natively but can‚Äôt? These are just a few questions to get you thinking about submissions to the initiative.\nSome of the submissions we‚Äôve had so far span from specific feature requests to broader problems with the web platform:\nI want browsers to fix automatically fixable accessibility problems automatically\nI want better HTML forms\nI want to be able to save/load debugger state\nI want performant width and height CSS transitions\n\nI want accessibility tools front and center\n\nThis is just a snapshot of the feedback we‚Äôre getting. The whole list is available for you to browse.\nWhy should I submit to the Web We Want? \nThis is an opportunity to make your voice heard and help us determine where the future of the web platform is headed. Once you‚Äôve submitted your problem or feature, we‚Äôll determine if your want is something that browser vendors can tackle directly or if it‚Äôs something that needs more scoping and is suited for Web Standards discussions.\nThis is an opportunity for all of us to take a step back and reassess where the future of the web is heading and figure out where the gaps are that make building for the web difficult today.\nHow can I participate?\nThere are a few different ways you can participate and there are a few different components to the Web We Want. First, think about what you think browser vendors should go fix and submit your ideas at webwewant.fyi. And that could be all that you want to do, which is great! We want any and all feedback about the platform and we have folks from different browsers constantly watching what‚Äôs being submitted. \nThere‚Äôs a second, optional aspect to the Web We Want, which is a great way to get involved in the web community and dip your toes in the public speaking pool. We‚Äôve been running the Web We Want as a community-focused panel session at conferences around the world. \nIf you submit and are attending one of the events we‚Äôll be at, your submission could be picked to be presented in a 3-5 minute lightning pitch to a panel of judges during the session, like an episode of Shark Tank but for tech. The live sessions we run are a way to get feedback and opinions from industry experts like Rachel Andrew, Jen Simmons, Miriam Suzanne, and Marcy Sutton.\nEven if you‚Äôre not attending one of the events in person, you can still participate! We want to be mindful that not everyone can attend conferences so if you your submission is selected and you indicate you‚Äôre not attending an event,you‚Äôll have an opportunity to record your lightning talk ahead of time and we‚Äôll include it in the live session. \nThe live session culminates with the judges deliberating and deciding on the most pressing ‚Äúwant‚Äù pitched during the session. We also have a community voting aspect that allows the event audience to rank what they think is the most pressing thing for browser vendors (or standards bodies) to work on. Even if you‚Äôre not attending an event, you can still vote for your favorite ‚Äúwants‚Äù on the website as well as by sharing them on social media. \nSo far we‚Äôve run sessions at An Event Apart DC, Smashing Conf, and View Source, and the community participation and panel discussion of wants has been fantastic. If you run a meetup or a conference and are interested in facilitating this session, reach out to Stephanie Stimac or Aaron Gustafson. \nThe Web We Want\nWe‚Äôre at a point in the web platform where browser vendors and standards bodies are eager to know what it is web developers and designers need in the platform. We need to know where to invest resources. Hop over to the Web We Want and let us know what you think the web platform needs so that we can shape the future of the web together. \nThe post Building the Web We Want appeared first on CSS-Tricks.\n\n\nShare this:\nFacebook\nLinkedIn\nReddit\nTwitter\nTumblr\nPinterest\n\nRelated"

Providing the connective tissue for no-middleman public conversations among independent websites remains a central promise of Webmention ‚Äî and also describes Fogknife‚Äôs most obvious use of it ‚Äî but the protocol has other, more subtle uses that may escape one‚Äôs first discovery of it.</p>\n\n<p>Through its very simple and general design, Webmention allows one website to remotely ‚Äî and consensually ‚Äî affect the content of another site by publishing something onto itself. That is, I post something, in public, to my own website, and the mere act of this causes another website, somewhere else, to automatically update its own content in some appropriate fashion. This can achieve a variety of purposes beyond comment and conversation that I find both fascinating and kind of hard to describe in one sentence! Please indulge me, then, as I explore this concept over the length of an article here.</p>\n\n<h2>Passive webmentions: comments, replies, and reactions</h2>\n\n<h3>An Alice-and-Bob example</h3>\n\n<p>Generally speaking, a webmention message notifies a website that one of its constituent pages was referenced on some other part of the public web. In the simplest common case, this happens when Alice publishes a new web page that uses an ordinary HTML hyperlink to refer to a page that Bob had posted earlier. For example, she might post a page at <code>https://alice.example.com/go-read-bob</code> whose content begins this way:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>Thoughts on Bob‚Äôs C-SI stability theory</strong></p>\n  \n  <p><em>by Alice</em></p>\n  \n  <p>My friend and colleague Bob wrote <a href=\"https://fogknife.com/2020-04-05-webmentions-active-and-passive.html#analice-and-bobexample\">a very interesting article</a> that everyone who follows my work should go read. Some real food for thought here.</p>\n  \n  <p>Regarding his theory about the stability of chrono-synclastic infidibuli, I would like to add my own observation that <em>[etc.]</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Let‚Äôs pretend that that hyperlink goes to <code>https://bobs-blog.example/my-theory</code>, a page on Bob‚Äôs website. Putting aside the mechanics of webmention transmission ‚Äî a rich topic on its own that I shall leave outside the scope of this article ‚Äî Alice‚Äôs content-management software will, on publishing this page, contact a webmention-receiver that Bob uses, letting it know that a page under its jurisdiction has received a mention from Alice‚Äôs new post. Bob‚Äôs software will confirm that this is true by loading and scanning the HTML of Alice‚Äôs post, and will then take some appropriate action, such as adding a summary of and link to Alice‚Äôs page to a ‚ÄúComments and reactions‚Äù section at the bottom of Bob‚Äôs page.</p>\n\n<p>There exist many variations of this basic model: perhaps Bob‚Äôs software takes a more cautious approach to public webmentions and holds it for manual approval, or perhaps Alice‚Äôs CMS knows how to mark up her post with microformats (more on which later) so that Bob‚Äôs software knows, in turn, more about the post‚Äôs author. Microformats can also mark Alice‚Äôs page as an intentional reply to Bob‚Äôs post, rather than a tangentially related page that links to it as a mere aside, and Bob‚Äôs CMS may wish to display the link back to Alice‚Äôs page differently given this fact.</p>\n\n<p>Regardless of these details, I think of this as a <strong>passive webmention</strong> example. Alice published her post with the main intent of sharing her ideals with her own readership. As a beneficial <em>side effect</em>, it also extended to Bob the courtesy of a webmention. He is free to treat this information however he wishes. It would be a nice gesture for Bob to let his software automatically link back to Alice‚Äôs response ‚Äî but if he delays or declines to do so, it would not make Alice‚Äôs link any less meaningful in the meantime.</p>\n\n<h3>Real-world passive webmentions with Fogknife</h3>\n\n<p>And this, in essence, desrcribes how Fogknife has used Webmention since 2018. The ‚Äúreactions‚Äù that decorate the bottom of many of my posts comprise a mix of Twitter-based responses (arriving, unbeknownst to those tweeters, via <a href=\"https://brid.gy\">Bridgy</a>), URLs manually entered via the ‚Äúsuggest a mention‚Äù form at the bottom of every Fogknife post-page, and intentional mentions sent from readers‚Äô own Webmention-aware software. In every case, Fogknife receives these messages as webmentions, and displays them in ways appropriate to each, whether a ‚Äúlike‚Äù, a repost, an explicit reply, or just a generic mention. <a href=\"https://fogknife.com/2018-04-22-announcing-two-new-indieweb-modules-for-perl.html#webmentions\">This post contains several</a>, in a variety of flavors*, coming from a mix of sources.</p>\n\n<p>You‚Äôll note that several of that post‚Äôs reactions have my own name attached. This happens because Fogknife also sends webmentions: its underlying software looks up the Webmention capability of each and every URL contained in every new or updated post, and sends a message to each receiver it discovers. This includes links to other Fogknife articles, because I don‚Äôt have Fogknife‚Äôs webmention listener treat webmentions sent from <code>fogknife.com</code> in any special way, compared to webmentions from any other source! If they are legitimate, they get published. And through this mechanism, I get to share a forward-linking ‚Äúrelated articles‚Äù feature on my older posts, at no extra effort.</p>\n\n<h2>Active webmentions: RSVPs, syndication, and more</h2>\n\n<p>Distinct from websites that accept and publish these sorts of by-happenstance webmentions, a site can set itself up to receive webmentions that possess a more intentional edge. In these cases, a webmention means more than a passive ‚Äúsay, someone referred to you over here‚Äù. Instead, it declares that the source prepared the link <em>primarily</em> to send a webmention to the linked website. The author expects the target to read a particular intent in the link, and react in some appropriate way. I think of these as <strong>active webmentions</strong>.</p>\n\n<p><em>This is the cool part</em>, so I shall skip the Alice-and-Bob basics and dive right into to some real-world examples.</p>\n\n<h3>My RSVP to a meeting in April</h3>\n\n<p>Through the same kind of microformats markup that can identify a link‚Äôs intent as a response to the article at the linked URL, the author of a page can declare a self-published post as their RSVP to a future event.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://events.indieweb.org\">The upcoming-events site for the worldwide IndieWeb community</a> (whence comes Webmention itself) accepts exactly these sorts of RSVP webmentions. Anyone using Webmention-aware publishing tools can create a public page declaring their intent to attend one of these events, naturally linking to that event‚Äôs page in the process. The Events website, on receipt of the mention, scans this new page for microformats that confirm the link‚Äôs intent as an RSVP, as well as the identity of the person submitting it.</p>\n\n<p>So, for a real example, let me pause and declare my <em><span class=\"p-rsvp\">yes</span></em> RSVP to <a href=\"https://events.indieweb.org/2020/04/online-indieweb-meetup-nyc-xzPxXTK5HGbe\" class=\"u-in-reply-to\">the April 15 IndieWeb NYC meetup</a>, which plans to gather via teleconference that evening (New York, alas, <a href=\"https://fogknife.com/2020-03-28-dispatch-from-locked-down-new-york-march-2020.html\">not presenting its best face</a> for in-person meetings at the moment).</p>\n\n<p>And <em>through no further action on my part</em>, by the mere publishing of the page you are now reading, my RSVP has appeared on that event page. And this is where Webmention starts feeling truly magical, to me. I made a webpage addressing my human readership, expressing the notion ‚ÄúI plan to attend this meeting‚Äù, and daemonic servants that overheard my desires flew into action, making those plans real.</p>\n\n<p>All this happens in line with core IndieWeb philosophy, where I publish my activity exclusively to my own domain, submitting nothing about my plans or desires to any company looking to make a buck off of my attention.</p>\n\n<p>(A small caveat: Sending an RSVP in the middle of a long blog post like this is <em>a bit unusual</em>, even though it works. A typical RSVP webmention will instead originate from a very short note serving only that one purpose. But, with the NYC meetup happening only a few days from now, I had to show off a little‚Ä¶)</p>\n\n<h3>About those Microformats</h3>\n\n<p>I can no longer resist getting technical for a bit, but I can at least save you a dive through this blog post‚Äôs source code to show you what the raw HTML of that RSVP paragraph looks like:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>&lt;p&gt;So, for a real example, let me pause and declare my &lt;em&gt;&lt;span class=‚Äù<strong>p-rsvp</strong>‚Äú&gt;yes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt; RSVP to &lt;a href=‚Äùhttps://events.indieweb.org/2020/04/online-indieweb-meetup-nyc-xzPxXTK5HGbe‚Äù class=‚Äù<strong>u-in-reply-to</strong>‚Äú&gt;the April 15 IndieWeb NYC meetup&lt;/a&gt;, which plans to gather via teleconference that evening.&lt;/p&gt;</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Here you see two microformats in play, both implemented as plain old HTML <code>class</code> attributes:</p>\n\n<ul><li><p>The <code>u-in-reply-to</code> crouched in the hyperlink means that this post means to catch the attention of the page it links to via Webmention, identifying itself as an intentional response. This is no typically off-hand reference to another page!</p></li>\n<li><p>The presence of a <code>p-rsvp</code> class further defines this reply-post as an RSVP, and specifically a ‚Äúyes‚Äù RSVP.‚Ä†</p></li>\n</ul><p>Furthermore, at the top of this post ‚Äî and, indeed, at the top of every single Fogknife post ‚Äî lurks some HTML that looks like this:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>&lt;data class=‚Äùp-author h-card‚Äù&gt;\n          &lt;data class=‚Äùp-name‚Äù value=‚ÄùJason McIntosh‚Äù&gt;&lt;/data&gt;\n          &lt;data class=‚Äùu-url‚Äù value=‚Äùhttp://jmac.org‚Äù&gt;&lt;/data&gt;\n          &lt;data class=‚Äùu-photo‚Äù value=‚Äùhttp://jmac.org/misc/old_unicorn.png‚Äù&gt;&lt;/data&gt;</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Just as that <code>p-author</code> microformat implies by its name, this <code>data</code> element identifies the author of this webpage for any software that cares to scan its content for machine-readable semantic content.</p>\n\n<p>And I, the fallible human author, don‚Äôt need to keep any of this particular syntax in mind: I have set up my publishing software to always stamp that <code>data</code> element at the top of every Fogknife page. I have also set up my text editor to make the addition of those RSVP-specific microformats as easy as selecting from a pull-down menu, so I don‚Äôt need to manually type all that stuff in every time I wish to invoke it.</p>\n\n<p>My publishing software also takes care of the far trickier business of actually preparing and sending webmentions to every URL that appears in my post, including the IndieWeb Events one, as a side-effect of my putting it online. It is up to the software running IndieWeb Events to receive the webmention, scan this blog post, and do the thing I intend it to do.</p>\n\n<p>From a programmer‚Äôs perspective, active webmentions are almost ‚Äî but not quite ‚Äî like calling a method on a remote API. The action that the ‚Äúprogrammer‚Äù takes, however, involves publishing something human-readable on a public URL; the main communication does not happen in the realm of raw JSON or XML payloads passing invisibly between two computers, as with a true API. The whole time, I act as a human speaking primarily with other humans, but I intentionally sprinkle my communications with the <em>sotto voce</em> asides of microformats we intend for our mechanical servants to overhear and react to with swift elegance.</p>\n\n<p>It appeals to me so much. I love it, and I want to see more of it.</p>\n\n<h3>Zero-click syndication</h3>\n\n<p>My own most frequent practical use of active webmentions involves syndication: a request that the webmention receiver simply republish (or at least link back to) the source post in some fashion. Most commonly, the target website serves as an aggregator, collecting web pages that deal with some particular topic. A page can automatically add itself to this list by including a syndication-microformatted link to such as site, and following up with a webmention.</p>\n\n<p>I know of two live examples of this, both of which Fogknife has invoked before:</p>\n\n<ul><li><p>Aaron Parecki‚Äôs <a href=\"https://news.indieweb.org/en\">IndieNews</a> collects articles of interest to the IndieWeb community. At the time of this writing, it posts several articles per month, all of which come to its attention via Webmention.</p></li>\n<li><p>Kicks Condor‚Äôs <a href=\"https://indieweb.xyz\">IndieWeb.xyz</a> is an experimental Reddit-style collection of ‚Äúsubs‚Äù, each of which focuses on a particular topic. My first contribution to it came via <a href=\"https://indieweb.xyz/en/books\">its <em>books</em> sub</a>, where I joined an ‚ÄúIndieWeb book club‚Äù activity last summer <a href=\"https://fogknife.com/2019-05-23-i-read-ruined-by-design.html\">by reading Mike Monteiro‚Äôs <em>Ruined by Design</em></a> and then adding a syndication link to IndieWeb.xyz in that post‚Äôs footer.</p></li>\n</ul><p>Naturally, the post you now read also links to both of these aggregators in its sign-off, a few paragraphs below this. If you check either website (or subscribe to their RSS feeds) around the time I published this page, you will find references to this article, constructed out of microformats-based metadata parsed out of this post via the same mechanisms that the RSVP sites use.</p>\n\n<h3>Polls, and who knows what else</h3>\n\n<p>Last week, gathering notes for this article, I asked <a href=\"https://chat.indieweb.org/\">the IndieWeb chat</a> for more examples of sites using active webmentions. In this way I learned about <a href=\"https://webwewant.fyi\">The Web We Want</a>, a project run by representatives of several browser manufacturers as a way to collect public opinion on future browser features. Anyone can post features they‚Äôd like to see, and then people can show their support for a specific proposal by <a href=\"https://webwewant.fyi/voting/\">sending ‚Äúbookmark‚Äù or ‚Äúlike‚Äù-flavored webmention to its detail page</a>. (You can also just tweet about it, according to the site, and I presume that gets turned into a webmention via Bridgy.)</p>\n\n<p>While not something I felt immediately drawn to participate in, this nonetheless makes me happy to see. I had not at all anticipated the use of Webmention as a polling medium, and seeing it used that way proves my hypothesis that the technology has potential for a vast array of creative, wonderful uses across the web, in a spectrum wider than I can currently imagine.</p>\n\n<p>Even though its use remains quite humbly obscure in mid-2020, I support Webmention because I love the things that I know it can do ‚Äî and because I have no idea what else it can do, <em>because nobody‚Äôs done it yet</em>. I want to help its future innovators discover Webmention and get inspired too, so I can start selfishly enjoying the further magic they end up bringing to the open web.</p>\n\n<p><em>This article was also posted to <a href=\"https://news.indieweb.org/en\" class=\"u-syndication\">IndieNews</a>, and to <a href=\"https://indieweb.xyz/en/indieweb\" class=\"u-syndication\">the ‚Äúindieweb‚Äù section of Indieweb.xyz</a>.</em></p>\n\n<p>* At the time of this writing, it also makes plain a bug that my blogging software has when trying to display user-avatar images that have changed since the original receipt of their associated webmentions; this explains all the broken images. My work this spring sees me making improvements to my own webmention-handling software, and I hope to share more about in in the coming months.</p>\n\n<p>‚Ä† Some references for this magic: <a href=\"https://indieweb.org/rsvp\">IndieWeb Wiki‚Äôs page on RSVP</a>; <a href=\"http://microformats.org/wiki/h-entry#Core_Properties\">Microformats.org documentation on <code>h-entry</code> properties</a>. (And note also that every Fogknife post is wrapped in an <code>h-entry</code> microformat.)</p>",

Putting aside the mechanics of webmention transmission ‚Äî a rich topic on its own that I shall leave outside the scope of this article ‚Äî Alice‚Äôs content-management software will, on publishing this page, contact a webmention-receiver that Bob uses, letting it know that a page under its jurisdiction has received a mention from Alice‚Äôs new post. Bob‚Äôs software will confirm that this is true by loading and scanning the HTML of Alice‚Äôs post, and will then take some appropriate action, such as adding a summary of and link to Alice‚Äôs page to a ‚ÄúComments and reactions‚Äù section at the bottom of Bob‚Äôs page.\n\nThere exist many variations of this basic model: perhaps Bob‚Äôs software takes a more cautious approach to public webmentions and holds it for manual approval, or perhaps Alice‚Äôs CMS knows how to mark up her post with microformats (more on which later) so that Bob‚Äôs software knows, in turn, more about the post‚Äôs author. Microformats can also mark Alice‚Äôs page as an intentional reply to Bob‚Äôs post, rather than a tangentially related page that links to it as a mere aside, and Bob‚Äôs CMS may wish to display the link back to Alice‚Äôs page differently given this fact.\n\nRegardless of these details, I think of this as a passive webmention example. Alice published her post with the main intent of sharing her ideals with her own readership. As a beneficial side effect, it also extended to Bob the courtesy of a webmention. He is free to treat this information however he wishes. It would be a nice gesture for Bob to let his software automatically link back to Alice‚Äôs response ‚Äî but if he delays or declines to do so, it would not make Alice‚Äôs link any less meaningful in the meantime.\n\nReal-world passive webmentions with Fogknife\n\nAnd this, in essence, desrcribes how Fogknife has used Webmention since 2018. The ‚Äúreactions‚Äù that decorate the bottom of many of my posts comprise a mix of Twitter-based responses (arriving, unbeknownst to those tweeters, via Bridgy), URLs manually entered via the ‚Äúsuggest a mention‚Äù form at the bottom of every Fogknife post-page, and intentional mentions sent from readers‚Äô own Webmention-aware software. In every case, Fogknife receives these messages as webmentions, and displays them in ways appropriate to each, whether a ‚Äúlike‚Äù, a repost, an explicit reply, or just a generic mention. This post contains several, in a variety of flavors*, coming from a mix of sources.\n\nYou‚Äôll note that several of that post‚Äôs reactions have my own name attached. This happens because Fogknife also sends webmentions: its underlying software looks up the Webmention capability of each and every URL contained in every new or updated post, and sends a message to each receiver it discovers. This includes links to other Fogknife articles, because I don‚Äôt have Fogknife‚Äôs webmention listener treat webmentions sent from fogknife.com in any special way, compared to webmentions from any other source! If they are legitimate, they get published. And through this mechanism, I get to share a forward-linking ‚Äúrelated articles‚Äù feature on my older posts, at no extra effort.\n\nActive webmentions: RSVPs, syndication, and more\n\nDistinct from websites that accept and publish these sorts of by-happenstance webmentions, a site can set itself up to receive webmentions that possess a more intentional edge. In these cases, a webmention means more than a passive ‚Äúsay, someone referred to you over here‚Äù. Instead, it declares that the source prepared the link primarily to send a webmention to the linked website. The author expects the target to read a particular intent in the link, and react in some appropriate way. I think of these as active webmentions.\n\nThis is the cool part, so I shall skip the Alice-and-Bob basics and dive right into to some real-world examples.\n\nMy RSVP to a meeting in April\n\nThrough the same kind of microformats markup that can identify a link‚Äôs intent as a response to the article at the linked URL, the author of a page can declare a self-published post as their RSVP to a future event.\n\nThe upcoming-events site for the worldwide IndieWeb community (whence comes Webmention itself) accepts exactly these sorts of RSVP webmentions. Anyone using Webmention-aware publishing tools can create a public page declaring their intent to attend one of these events, naturally linking to that event‚Äôs page in the process. The Events website, on receipt of the mention, scans this new page for microformats that confirm the link‚Äôs intent as an RSVP, as well as the identity of the person submitting it.\n\nSo, for a real example, let me pause and declare my yes RSVP to the April 15 IndieWeb NYC meetup, which plans to gather via teleconference that evening (New York, alas, not presenting its best face for in-person meetings at the moment).\n\nAnd through no further action on my part, by the mere publishing of the page you are now reading, my RSVP has appeared on that event page. And this is where Webmention starts feeling truly magical, to me. I made a webpage addressing my human readership, expressing the notion ‚ÄúI plan to attend this meeting‚Äù, and daemonic servants that overheard my desires flew into action, making those plans real.\n\nAll this happens in line with core IndieWeb philosophy, where I publish my activity exclusively to my own domain, submitting nothing about my plans or desires to any company looking to make a buck off of my attention.\n\n(A small caveat: Sending an RSVP in the middle of a long blog post like this is a bit unusual, even though it works. A typical RSVP webmention will instead originate from a very short note serving only that one purpose. But, with the NYC meetup happening only a few days from now, I had to show off a little‚Ä¶)\n\nAbout those Microformats\n\nI can no longer resist getting technical for a bit, but I can at least save you a dive through this blog post‚Äôs source code to show you what the raw HTML of that RSVP paragraph looks like:\n\n\n  <p>So, for a real example, let me pause and declare my <em><span class=‚Äùp-rsvp‚Äú>yes</span></em> RSVP to <a href=‚Äùhttps://events.indieweb.org/2020/04/online-indieweb-meetup-nyc-xzPxXTK5HGbe‚Äù class=‚Äùu-in-reply-to‚Äú>the April 15 IndieWeb NYC meetup</a>, which plans to gather via teleconference that evening.</p>\n\n\nHere you see two microformats in play, both implemented as plain old HTML class attributes:\n\nThe u-in-reply-to crouched in the hyperlink means that this post means to catch the attention of the page it links to via Webmention, identifying itself as an intentional response. This is no typically off-hand reference to another page!\nThe presence of a p-rsvp class further defines this reply-post as an RSVP, and specifically a ‚Äúyes‚Äù RSVP.‚Ä†\nFurthermore, at the top of this post ‚Äî and, indeed, at the top of every single Fogknife post ‚Äî lurks some HTML that looks like this:\n\n\n  <data class=‚Äùp-author h-card‚Äù>\n          <data class=‚Äùp-name‚Äù value=‚ÄùJason McIntosh‚Äù></data>\n          <data class=‚Äùu-url‚Äù value=‚Äùhttp://jmac.org‚Äù></data>\n          <data class=‚Äùu-photo‚Äù value=‚Äùhttp://jmac.org/misc/old_unicorn.png‚Äù></data>\n\n\nJust as that p-author microformat implies by its name, this data element identifies the author of this webpage for any software that cares to scan its content for machine-readable semantic content.\n\nAnd I, the fallible human author, don‚Äôt need to keep any of this particular syntax in mind: I have set up my publishing software to always stamp that data element at the top of every Fogknife page. I have also set up my text editor to make the addition of those RSVP-specific microformats as easy as selecting from a pull-down menu, so I don‚Äôt need to manually type all that stuff in every time I wish to invoke it.\n\nMy publishing software also takes care of the far trickier business of actually preparing and sending webmentions to every URL that appears in my post, including the IndieWeb Events one, as a side-effect of my putting it online. It is up to the software running IndieWeb Events to receive the webmention, scan this blog post, and do the thing I intend it to do.\n\nFrom a programmer‚Äôs perspective, active webmentions are almost ‚Äî but not quite ‚Äî like calling a method on a remote API. The action that the ‚Äúprogrammer‚Äù takes, however, involves publishing something human-readable on a public URL; the main communication does not happen in the realm of raw JSON or XML payloads passing invisibly between two computers, as with a true API. The whole time, I act as a human speaking primarily with other humans, but I intentionally sprinkle my communications with the sotto voce asides of microformats we intend for our mechanical servants to overhear and react to with swift elegance.\n\nIt appeals to me so much. I love it, and I want to see more of it.\n\nZero-click syndication\n\nMy own most frequent practical use of active webmentions involves syndication: a request that the webmention receiver simply republish (or at least link back to) the source post in some fashion. Most commonly, the target website serves as an aggregator, collecting web pages that deal with some particular topic. A page can automatically add itself to this list by including a syndication-microformatted link to such as site, and following up with a webmention.\n\nI know of two live examples of this, both of which Fogknife has invoked before:\n\nAaron Parecki‚Äôs IndieNews collects articles of interest to the IndieWeb community. At the time of this writing, it posts several articles per month, all of which come to its attention via Webmention.\nKicks Condor‚Äôs IndieWeb.xyz is an experimental Reddit-style collection of ‚Äúsubs‚Äù, each of which focuses on a particular topic. My first contribution to it came via its books sub, where I joined an ‚ÄúIndieWeb book club‚Äù activity last summer by reading Mike Monteiro‚Äôs Ruined by Design and then adding a syndication link to IndieWeb.xyz in that post‚Äôs footer.\nNaturally, the post you now read also links to both of these aggregators in its sign-off, a few paragraphs below this. If you check either website (or subscribe to their RSS feeds) around the time I published this page, you will find references to this article, constructed out of microformats-based metadata parsed out of this post via the same mechanisms that the RSVP sites use.\n\nPolls, and who knows what else\n\nLast week, gathering notes for this article, I asked the IndieWeb chat for more examples of sites using active webmentions. In this way I learned about The Web We Want, a project run by representatives of several browser manufacturers as a way to collect public opinion on future browser features. Anyone can post features they‚Äôd like to see, and then people can show their support for a specific proposal by sending ‚Äúbookmark‚Äù or ‚Äúlike‚Äù-flavored webmention to its detail page. (You can also just tweet about it, according to the site, and I presume that gets turned into a webmention via Bridgy.)\n\nWhile not something I felt immediately drawn to participate in, this nonetheless makes me happy to see. I had not at all anticipated the use of Webmention as a polling medium, and seeing it used that way proves my hypothesis that the technology has potential for a vast array of creative, wonderful uses across the web, in a spectrum wider than I can currently imagine.\n\nEven though its use remains quite humbly obscure in mid-2020, I support Webmention because I love the things that I know it can do ‚Äî and because I have no idea what else it can do, because nobody‚Äôs done it yet. I want to help its future innovators discover Webmention and get inspired too, so I can start selfishly enjoying the further magic they end up bringing to the open web.\n\nThis article was also posted to IndieNews, and to the ‚Äúindieweb‚Äù section of Indieweb.xyz.\n\n* At the time of this writing, it also makes plain a bug that my blogging software has when trying to display user-avatar images that have changed since the original receipt of their associated webmentions; this explains all the broken images. My work this spring sees me making improvements to my own webmention-handling software, and I hope to share more about in in the coming months.\n\n‚Ä† Some references for this magic: IndieWeb Wiki‚Äôs page on RSVP; Microformats.org documentation on h-entry properties. (And note also that every Fogknife post is wrapped in an h-entry microformat.)"

Providing the connective tissue for no-middleman public conversations among independent websites remains a central promise of Webmention ‚Äî and also describes Fogknife‚Äôs most obvious use of it ‚Äî but the protocol has other, more subtle uses that may escape one‚Äôs first discovery of it.</p>\n\n<p>Through its very simple and general design, Webmention allows one website to remotely ‚Äî and consensually ‚Äî affect the content of another site by publishing something onto itself. That is, I post something, in public, to my own website, and the mere act of this causes another website, somewhere else, to automatically update its own content in some appropriate fashion. This can achieve a variety of purposes beyond comment and conversation that I find both fascinating and kind of hard to describe in one sentence! Please indulge me, then, as I explore this concept over the length of an article here.</p>\n\n<h2>Passive webmentions: comments, replies, and reactions</h2>\n\n<h3>An Alice-and-Bob example</h3>\n\n<p>Generally speaking, a webmention message notifies a website that one of its constituent pages was referenced on some other part of the public web. In the simplest common case, this happens when Alice publishes a new web page that uses an ordinary HTML hyperlink to refer to a page that Bob had posted earlier. For example, she might post a page at <code>https://alice.example.com/go-read-bob</code> whose content begins this way:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>Thoughts on Bob‚Äôs C-SI stability theory</strong></p>\n  \n  <p><em>by Alice</em></p>\n  \n  <p>My friend and colleague Bob wrote <a href=\"https://fogknife.com/2020-04-05-webmentions-active-and-passive.html#analice-and-bobexample\">a very interesting article</a> that everyone who follows my work should go read. Some real food for thought here.</p>\n  \n  <p>Regarding his theory about the stability of chrono-synclastic infidibuli, I would like to add my own observation that <em>[etc.]</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Let‚Äôs pretend that that hyperlink goes to <code>https://bobs-blog.example/my-theory</code>, a page on Bob‚Äôs website.

        "text": "‚ÄúTelephone Wires‚Äù by oatsy40 is licensed under CC BY 2.0I first discovered Webmention by its ability to serve as a federated cross-site commenting system, one free of the baggage inherent to elsewhere-centralized systems I‚Äôd tried earlier. Providing the connective tissue for no-middleman public conversations among independent websites remains a central promise of Webmention ‚Äî and also describes Fogknife‚Äôs most obvious use of it ‚Äî but the protocol has other, more subtle uses that may escape one‚Äôs first discovery of it.\n\nThrough its very simple and general design, Webmention allows one website to remotely ‚Äî and consensually ‚Äî affect the content of another site by publishing something onto itself. That is, I post something, in public, to my own website, and the mere act of this causes another website, somewhere else, to automatically update its own content in some appropriate fashion. This can achieve a variety of purposes beyond comment and conversation that I find both fascinating and kind of hard to describe in one sentence! Please indulge me, then, as I explore this concept over the length of an article here.\n\nPassive webmentions: comments, replies, and reactions\n\nAn Alice-and-Bob example\n\nGenerally speaking, a webmention message notifies a website that one of its constituent pages was referenced on some other part of the public web. In the simplest common case, this happens when Alice publishes a new web page that uses an ordinary HTML hyperlink to refer to a page that Bob had posted earlier. For example, she might post a page at https://alice.example.com/go-read-bob whose content begins this way:\n\n\n  Thoughts on Bob‚Äôs C-SI stability theory\n  \n  by Alice\n  \n  My friend and colleague Bob wrote a very interesting article that everyone who follows my work should go read. Some real food for thought here.\n  \n  Regarding his theory about the stability of chrono-synclastic infidibuli, I would like to add my own observation that [etc.]\n\n\nLet‚Äôs pretend that that hyperlink goes to https://bobs-blog.example/my-theory, a page on Bob‚Äôs website. Putting aside the mechanics of webmention transmission ‚Äî a rich topic on its own that I shall leave outside the scope of this article ‚Äî Alice‚Äôs content-management software will, on publishing this page, contact a webmention-receiver that Bob uses, letting it know that a page under its jurisdiction has received a mention from Alice‚Äôs new post. Bob‚Äôs software will confirm that this is true by loading and scanning the HTML of Alice‚Äôs post, and will then take some appropriate action, such as adding a summary of and link to Alice‚Äôs page to a ‚ÄúComments and reactions‚Äù section at the bottom of Bob‚Äôs page.\n\nThere exist many variations of this basic model: perhaps Bob‚Äôs software takes a more cautious approach to public webmentions and holds it for manual approval, or perhaps Alice‚Äôs CMS knows how to mark up her post with microformats (more on which later) so that Bob‚Äôs software knows, in turn, more about the post‚Äôs author. Microformats can also mark Alice‚Äôs page as an intentional reply to Bob‚Äôs post, rather than a tangentially related page that links to it as a mere aside, and Bob‚Äôs CMS may wish to display the link back to Alice‚Äôs page differently given this fact.\n\nRegardless of these details, I think of this as a passive webmention example. Alice published her post with the main intent of sharing her ideals with her own readership. As a beneficial side effect, it also extended to Bob the courtesy of a webmention. He is free to treat this information however he wishes. It would be a nice gesture for Bob to let his software automatically link back to Alice‚Äôs response ‚Äî but if he delays or declines to do so, it would not make Alice‚Äôs link any less meaningful in the meantime.\n\nReal-world passive webmentions with Fogknife\n\nAnd this, in essence, desrcribes how Fogknife has used Webmention since 2018. The ‚Äúreactions‚Äù that decorate the bottom of many of my posts comprise a mix of Twitter-based responses (arriving, unbeknownst to those tweeters, via Bridgy), URLs manually entered via the ‚Äúsuggest a mention‚Äù form at the bottom of every Fogknife post-page, and intentional mentions sent from readers‚Äô own Webmention-aware software. In every case, Fogknife receives these messages as webmentions, and displays them in ways appropriate to each, whether a ‚Äúlike‚Äù, a repost, an explicit reply, or just a generic mention. This post contains several, in a variety of flavors*, coming from a mix of sources.\n\nYou‚Äôll note that several of that post‚Äôs reactions have my own name attached. This happens because Fogknife also sends webmentions: its underlying software looks up the Webmention capability of each and every URL contained in every new or updated post, and sends a message to each receiver it discovers. This includes links to other Fogknife articles, because I don‚Äôt have Fogknife‚Äôs webmention listener treat webmentions sent from fogknife.com in any special way, compared to webmentions from any other source! If they are legitimate, they get published. And through this mechanism, I get to share a forward-linking ‚Äúrelated articles‚Äù feature on my older posts, at no extra effort.\n\nActive webmentions: RSVPs, syndication, and more\n\nDistinct from websites that accept and publish these sorts of by-happenstance webmentions, a site can set itself up to receive webmentions that possess a more intentional edge. In these cases, a webmention means more than a passive ‚Äúsay, someone referred to you over here‚Äù. Instead, it declares that the source prepared the link primarily to send a webmention to the linked website. The author expects the target to read a particular intent in the link, and react in some appropriate way. I think of these as active webmentions.\n\nThis is the cool part, so I shall skip the Alice-and-Bob basics and dive right into to some real-world examples.\n\nMy RSVP to a meeting in April\n\nThrough the same kind of microformats markup that can identify a link‚Äôs intent as a response to the article at the linked URL, the author of a page can declare a self-published post as their RSVP to a future event.\n\nThe upcoming-events site for the worldwide IndieWeb community (whence comes Webmention itself) accepts exactly these sorts of RSVP webmentions. Anyone using Webmention-aware publishing tools can create a public page declaring their intent to attend one of these events, naturally linking to that event‚Äôs page in the process. The Events website, on receipt of the mention, scans this new page for microformats that confirm the link‚Äôs intent as an RSVP, as well as the identity of the person submitting it.\n\nSo, for a real example, let me pause and declare my yes RSVP to the April 15 IndieWeb NYC meetup, which plans to gather via teleconference that evening (New York, alas, not presenting its best face for in-person meetings at the moment).\n\nAnd through no further action on my part, by the mere publishing of the page you are now reading, my RSVP has appeared on that event page. And this is where Webmention starts feeling truly magical, to me. I made a webpage addressing my human readership, expressing the notion ‚ÄúI plan to attend this meeting‚Äù, and daemonic servants that overheard my desires flew into action, making those plans real.\n\nAll this happens in line with core IndieWeb philosophy, where I publish my activity exclusively to my own domain, submitting nothing about my plans or desires to any company looking to make a buck off of my attention.\n\n(A small caveat: Sending an RSVP in the middle of a long blog post like this is a bit unusual, even though it works. A typical RSVP webmention will instead originate from a very short note serving only that one purpose. But, with the NYC meetup happening only a few days from now, I had to show off a little‚Ä¶)\n\nAbout those Microformats\n\nI can no longer resist getting technical for a bit, but I can at least save you a dive through this blog post‚Äôs source code to show you what the raw HTML of that RSVP paragraph looks like:\n\n\n  <p>So, for a real example, let me pause and declare my <em><span class=‚Äùp-rsvp‚Äú>yes</span></em> RSVP to <a href=‚Äùhttps://events.indieweb.org/2020/04/online-indieweb-meetup-nyc-xzPxXTK5HGbe‚Äù class=‚Äùu-in-reply-to‚Äú>the April 15 IndieWeb NYC meetup</a>, which plans to gather via teleconference that evening.</p>\n\n\nHere you see two microformats in play, both implemented as plain old HTML class attributes:\n\nThe u-in-reply-to crouched in the hyperlink means that this post means to catch the attention of the page it links to via Webmention, identifying itself as an intentional response. This is no typically off-hand reference to another page!\nThe presence of a p-rsvp class further defines this reply-post as an RSVP, and specifically a ‚Äúyes‚Äù RSVP.‚Ä†\nFurthermore, at the top of this post ‚Äî and, indeed, at the top of every single Fogknife post ‚Äî lurks some HTML that looks like this:\n\n\n  <data class=‚Äùp-author h-card‚Äù>\n          <data class=‚Äùp-name‚Äù value=‚ÄùJason McIntosh‚Äù></data>\n          <data class=‚Äùu-url‚Äù value=‚Äùhttp://jmac.org‚Äù></data>\n          <data class=‚Äùu-photo‚Äù value=‚Äùhttp://jmac.org/misc/old_unicorn.png‚Äù></data>\n\n\nJust as that p-author microformat implies by its name, this data element identifies the author of this webpage for any software that cares to scan its content for machine-readable semantic content.\n\nAnd I, the fallible human author, don‚Äôt need to keep any of this particular syntax in mind: I have set up my publishing software to always stamp that data element at the top of every Fogknife page. I have also set up my text editor to make the addition of those RSVP-specific microformats as easy as selecting from a pull-down menu, so I don‚Äôt need to manually type all that stuff in every time I wish to invoke it.\n\nMy publishing software also takes care of the far trickier business of actually preparing and sending webmentions to every URL that appears in my post, including the IndieWeb Events one, as a side-effect of my putting it online. It is up to the software running IndieWeb Events to receive the webmention, scan this blog post, and do the thing I intend it to do.\n\nFrom a programmer‚Äôs perspective, active webmentions are almost ‚Äî but not quite ‚Äî like calling a method on a remote API. The action that the ‚Äúprogrammer‚Äù takes, however, involves publishing something human-readable on a public URL; the main communication does not happen in the realm of raw JSON or XML payloads passing invisibly between two computers, as with a true API. The whole time, I act as a human speaking primarily with other humans, but I intentionally sprinkle my communications with the sotto voce asides of microformats we intend for our mechanical servants to overhear and react to with swift elegance.\n\nIt appeals to me so much. I love it, and I want to see more of it.\n\nZero-click syndication\n\nMy own most frequent practical use of active webmentions involves syndication: a request that the webmention receiver simply republish (or at least link back to) the source post in some fashion. Most commonly, the target website serves as an aggregator, collecting web pages that deal with some particular topic. A page can automatically add itself to this list by including a syndication-microformatted link to such as site, and following up with a webmention.\n\nI know of two live examples of this, both of which Fogknife has invoked before:\n\nAaron Parecki‚Äôs IndieNews collects articles of interest to the IndieWeb community. At the time of this writing, it posts several articles per month, all of which come to its attention via Webmention.\nKicks Condor‚Äôs IndieWeb.xyz is an experimental Reddit-style collection of ‚Äúsubs‚Äù, each of which focuses on a particular topic. My first contribution to it came via its books sub, where I joined an ‚ÄúIndieWeb book club‚Äù activity last summer by reading Mike Monteiro‚Äôs Ruined by Design and then adding a syndication link to IndieWeb.xyz in that post‚Äôs footer.\nNaturally, the post you now read also links to both of these aggregators in its sign-off, a few paragraphs below this. If you check either website (or subscribe to their RSS feeds) around the time I published this page, you will find references to this article, constructed out of microformats-based metadata parsed out of this post via the same mechanisms that the RSVP sites use.\n\nPolls, and who knows what else\n\nLast week, gathering notes for this article, I asked the IndieWeb chat for more examples of sites using active webmentions. In this way I learned about The Web We Want, a project run by representatives of several browser manufacturers as a way to collect public opinion on future browser features. Anyone can post features they‚Äôd like to see, and then people can show their support for a specific proposal by sending ‚Äúbookmark‚Äù or ‚Äúlike‚Äù-flavored webmention to its detail page. (You can also just tweet about it, according to the site, and I presume that gets turned into a webmention via Bridgy.)\n\nWhile not something I felt immediately drawn to participate in, this nonetheless makes me happy to see. I had not at all anticipated the use of Webmention as a polling medium, and seeing it used that way proves my hypothesis that the technology has potential for a vast array of creative, wonderful uses across the web, in a spectrum wider than I can currently imagine.\n\nEven though its use remains quite humbly obscure in mid-2020, I support Webmention because I love the things that I know it can do ‚Äî and because I have no idea what else it can do, because nobody‚Äôs done it yet. I want to help its future innovators discover Webmention and get inspired too, so I can start selfishly enjoying the further magic they end up bringing to the open web.\n\nThis article was also posted to IndieNews, and to the ‚Äúindieweb‚Äù section of Indieweb.xyz.\n\n* At the time of this writing, it also makes plain a bug that my blogging software has when trying to display user-avatar images that have changed since the original receipt of their associated webmentions; this explains all the broken images. My work this spring sees me making improvements to my own webmention-handling software, and I hope to share more about in in the coming months.\n\n‚Ä† Some references for this magic: IndieWeb Wiki‚Äôs page on RSVP; Microformats.org documentation on h-entry properties.
