Working on a solution? Digital accessibility should be a hard requirement. Full stop. If the ‚Äúsolution‚Äù isn‚Äôt accessible, then you haven‚Äôt found the solution yet. Keep working on it- you‚Äôll get there! Check out tools like <a href=\"https://assistivlabs.com/\">Assistiv Labs</a>, that might be able to help with cross-browser/platform testing.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Train</strong> to be a master. No one can do this overnight. Integrate training for all parts of your organization- hire experts to come in and provide training. Look for reputable online courses. Start adding in accessibility audits to code reviews and even consider making it a facet of annual employee reviews for developers that create code for the front-end. Change can be hard, but change starts with each one of us, and happens with every decision we make along the way.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Participate</strong> in the process. Submit your ideas and wants to <a href=\"https://webwewant.fyi/wants/\">The Web We Want</a> project. File issues with browsers and frameworks, and make it clear that you want this from them. When you figure out that an ARIA authoring practice doesn‚Äôt work in your app, <a href=\"https://github.com/w3c/aria-practices\">file an issue on GitHub</a>.</li>\n</ol><h2>Imagining the world of tomorrow</h2>\n<p>After the practical things to help us right now, though, we can turn our thoughts to the developer experience we imagine having in the future.</p>\n<p>I recently started a project called <a href=\"https://melsumner.gitbook.io/ember-component-patterns/\">ember-component-patterns</a>, which is specifically for Ember.js users but could be expanded for all frameworks. While still in its infancy, the project aims to take accessibility development one step further, by showing patterns, anti-patterns, ideas for styling, semantic HTML and how to turn all of that into an Ember component. There are too many bridges yet to build between the islands of JavaScript developers, web developers, designers, and anyone else involved in building digital products. I think this project will, at its completion, do its part to build a bridge or two. And maybe inspire a few more along the way.</p>\n<p>Another imagination- what about a command-line tool for developers to review their own sites in the same way a screen reader would? Think more like a text adventure game- only it‚Äôs a tool for making sure you haven‚Äôt inadvertently created a keyboard trap, or content that doesn‚Äôt get properly exposed because it lacks appropriate semantics. I like this idea because I think it could provide a bridge between users with assistive technology and JavaScript engineers who spend their time at the command line. Experiencing the frustrations of the user with assistive technology within the medium that the engineer is familiar with would be a new approach to helping software engineers become more aware of what their code needs to actually do from a technical perspective. Plus, I think this would be <em>really fun to use</em>.</p>\n<p>Finally- how could we better signal the intent of a piece of code, or part of a website? After all, successful digital accessibility is the capability to express intent in a machine-readable way, so that a developer‚Äôs code can be interpreted properly by the assistive technology. I don‚Äôt think we have the tools past semantic HTML &amp; ARIA right now, and I think some imagination and experimentation has an opportunity to thrive here. We can create custom components to do some very cool things, but we need a new way to describe the intent and purpose of them to assistive technology.</p>\n<h2>It could be amazing- we just have to decide</h2>\n<p>While it is probably more likely than not that accessibility may have to be forced on developers by browsers (and who knows what that solution would look like), I dearly hope that this is not the inevitable future of our industry. I hope that our tenacity and ingenuity, paired with our creativity and imagination, will lead us to a different place entirely. My hope is that we will be <strong><em>inspired</em></strong> to create the world we want to live in, create the tech that allows us to develop inclusive experiences in a way that is fun for us, and makes the digital world possible for those who need it.</p>\n<p>The digital future is inclusive for all kinds of users- there is no changing this or stopping it. It has already been decided and it is already happening. Those on the forefront of the what some would call the last frontier in tech are already showing us the way. While we could just wait to see what legal regulations and tech giants hand to us, <em>it doesn‚Äôt have to be that way</em>. <strong>We</strong> can create the tools that <em>we want</em> to use, that are fun to use, and that take us to the next level of web development.</p>\n<p>We can create the the tools of tomorrow that we really want. Let‚Äôs seize this opportunity and create something incredible.</p>",

After all, successful digital accessibility is the capability to express intent in a machine-readable way, so that a developer‚Äôs code can be interpreted properly by the assistive technology. I don‚Äôt think we have the tools past semantic HTML & ARIA right now, and I think some imagination and experimentation has an opportunity to thrive here. We can create custom components to do some very cool things, but we need a new way to describe the intent and purpose of them to assistive technology.\nIt could be amazing- we just have to decide\nWhile it is probably more likely than not that accessibility may have to be forced on developers by browsers (and who knows what that solution would look like), I dearly hope that this is not the inevitable future of our industry. I hope that our tenacity and ingenuity, paired with our creativity and imagination, will lead us to a different place entirely. My hope is that we will be inspired to create the world we want to live in, create the tech that allows us to develop inclusive experiences in a way that is fun for us, and makes the digital world possible for those who need it.\nThe digital future is inclusive for all kinds of users- there is no changing this or stopping it. It has already been decided and it is already happening. Those on the forefront of the what some would call the last frontier in tech are already showing us the way. While we could just wait to see what legal regulations and tech giants hand to us, it doesn‚Äôt have to be that way. We can create the tools that we want to use, that are fun to use, and that take us to the next level of web development.\nWe can create the the tools of tomorrow that we really want. Let‚Äôs seize this opportunity and create something incredible."

Example: <abbr title=\"User Experience/User Interface design. I just say 'design'.\">UX/UI design</abbr>.</p>\n<h2>My solution for semantic sidenotes</h2>\n<p>My solution for now is a combination of HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The HTML looks like this:</p>\n<pre><code>\n</code></pre><pre><code>1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n</code></pre><code>\n\n\n</code><pre><code><span></span>\n<span></span></code></pre><p><code></code></p><code> <span>Some</span> <span>sentence</span> <span>with</span> <span>a</span><span></span><span>span</span> <span>class=</span><span>\"sidenote sidenote--collapsed\"</span><span>&gt;</span>\n  <span><span></span> <span>class=</span><span>\"sidenote sidenote--collapsed\"</span><span>&gt;</span>\n    <span><span></span>\n      <span>class=</span><span>\"sidenote__button\"</span>\n      <span>tabindex=</span><span>\"0\"</span>\n      <span>title=</span><span>\"Here's the content of the sidenote.\"</span>\n      <span>onKeypress=</span><span>\"handleSidenoteKeypress(event)\"</span>\n      <span>onClick=</span><span>\"handleSidenoteButtonClick(event)\"</span><span>&gt;</span>\n        label\n      <span></span></span>\n    <span></span> <span>class=</span><span>\"sidenote__content\"</span><span>&gt;</span>\n      <span><span></span> <span>class=</span><span>\"sidenote__content-parenthesis\"</span><span>&gt;</span>\n        (sidenote:\n      <span></span></span>\n      Here's the content of the sidenote\n      <span><span></span> <span>class=</span><span>\"sidenote__content-parenthesis\"</span><span>&gt;</span>\n        )\n      <span></span></span>\n    <span></span>\n  <span></span></span>\nfor the sidenote.<span></span>\n\n\n</code><p><code></code></p><code></code><p>I wrap the whole thing in a span, <span><br /><span title=\"As a nice side effect, on large screens, where the sidenote appears next to the body text, both asterisks get hover styling when one either the content or the inline span has the mouse cursor over it.\">mainly</span><br /><br /><span> (sidenote: </span><br />\n    As a nice side effect, on large screens, where the sidenote appears next to the body text, both asterisks get hover styling when one either the content or the inline span has the mouse cursor over it.<br /><span>)</span><br /><br /></span><br />\n to keep the required JavaScript simple.</p>\n<p>Then there‚Äôs the inline phrase that gets the asterisk. The <code></code> tag would be perfect for it, but buttons are hidden by Safari and Firefox‚Äôs reader modes, leaving a gap in the sentence. With <code>tabindex=\"0\"</code> and some CSS, the thing seems to behave pretty much like a button. It has a <code>title</code> attribute, so the content is also shown on mouse hover.</p>\n<p>For the sidenote content I use the <code></code> element. <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/small\">MDN says</a> it was made for representing side comments and small print. So semantically that‚Äôs pretty good. It has an additional benefit: by default it should be rendered with a smaller font size. So even when CSS is not applied, like in my RSS reader, it should appear smaller.</p>\n<p>The spans with the class <code>sidenote__content-parenthesis</code> are hidden with CSS. They‚Äôre mainly there for screen readers. I found that when my iPhone reads my posts out loud, only adding parenthesis around the sidenotes is confusing. By adding the phrase ‚Äòsidenote: ‚Äò, it‚Äôs much clearer why the sentence is interrupted.</p>\n<p>The JavaScript I added is straightforward; it just toggles classes on the wrapper span <code>sidenote</code>:</p>\n<pre><code>\n</code></pre><pre><code>1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n</code></pre><code>\n\n\n</code><pre><code><span>function</span> <span>handleSidenoteButtonClick</span><span>(</span><span>e</span><span>){</span>\n  <span>const</span> <span>el</span><span>=</span><span>e</span><span>.</span><span>target</span><span>;</span>\n  <span>el</span><span>.</span><span>parentNode</span><span>.</span><span>classList</span><span>.</span><span>toggle</span><span>(</span><span>'</span><span>sidenote--expanded</span><span>'</span><span>);</span>\n  <span>el</span><span>.</span><span>parentNode</span><span>.</span><span>classList</span><span>.</span><span>toggle</span><span>(</span><span>'</span><span>sidenote--collapsed</span><span>'</span><span>);</span>\n  <span>el</span><span>.</span><span>blur</span><span>();</span>\n<span>}</span>\n\n<span>function</span> <span>handleSidenoteKeypress</span><span>(</span><span>e</span><span>){</span>\n  <span>if</span><span>(</span><span>e</span><span>.</span><span>key</span> <span>===</span> <span>'</span><span>Enter</span><span>'</span> <span>||</span> <span>e</span><span>.</span><span>key</span> <span>===</span> <span>'</span><span> </span><span>'</span><span>){</span>\n    <span>const</span> <span>el</span><span>=</span><span>e</span><span>.</span><span>target</span><span>;</span>\n    <span>e</span><span>.</span><span>preventDefault</span><span>();</span>\n    <span>el</span><span>.</span><span>parentNode</span><span>.</span><span>classList</span><span>.</span><span>toggle</span><span>(</span><span>'</span><span>sidenote--expanded</span><span>'</span><span>);</span>\n    <span>el</span><span>.</span><span>parentNode</span><span>.</span><span>classList</span><span>.</span><span>toggle</span><span>(</span><span>'</span><span>sidenote--collapsed</span><span>'</span><span>);</span>\n  <span>};</span>\n<span>}</span>\n</code></pre><code>\n\n</code><p><code></code></p><code></code><p>There‚Äôs a whole bunch of CSS to make the content appear in the right place, hide it by default on small screens and to add the asterisks. I‚Äôm not going to include all of it‚Äîuse the inspector of you‚Äôre interested. But it‚Äôs worth mentioning that just hiding the sidenote‚Äôs content with <code>display: none</code> causes it to be ignored by screen readers. So instead, I hide it like this:</p>\n<pre><code><span>.sidenote--collapsed</span> <span>.sidenote__content</span><span>,</span>\n<span>.sidenote__content-parenthesis</span><span>{</span>\n  <span>position</span><span>:</span> <span>absolute</span><span>;</span>\n  <span>left</span><span>:</span> <span>-99999px</span><span>;</span>\n  <span>top</span><span>:</span> <span>auto</span><span>;</span>\n<span>}</span></code></pre>\n<h2>Is this solution good enough?</h2>\n<p>The solution above looks good in the major browsers; when CSS is applied things look as intended. When CSS is not available, default styles make the everything look as intended. In that scenario, the content in the example code above would look like this: ‚Äú(sidenote: Here‚Äôs the content of the sidenote)‚Äù. No weird line breaks there. The only screen reader test I did was with iOS. It speaks the text just as intended, including the ‚Äòsidenote:‚Äô part of it (which is the reason I included that part, otherwise the sentences sound weird).</p>\n<p>For non-standard browsers, support is okay-ish. Firefox‚Äôs and Desktop Safari‚Äôs reader views do a fine job. It correctly renders the content within the <code></code> tags smaller. Same for The RSS reader I use, Reeder. Chrome‚Äôs <span><br /><span title=\"Jeez Chrome, how is this still experimental?!\">experimental</span><br /><br /><span> (sidenote: </span><br />\n    Jeez Chrome, how is this still experimental?!<br /><span>)</span><br /><br /></span><br />\n reader mode adds some superfluous linebreaks, but doesn‚Äôt remove any content. Mobile Safari‚Äôs reader view hides the sidenote content, but the button span remains, so there‚Äôs still a readable main article. Pocket however, just hides the whole <code>.sidenote</code> span‚Äîweird!</p>\n<p>The worst part of the solution is that requires CSS and JavaScript. There‚Äôs a lot of HTML. I guess it‚Äôs hard to add to CMSs. And it feels icky that the clickable part  has to be a <code><span></span></code>.</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>Arguably, I (and you) would be better off, If I tried to write more concisely. But beyond this blog, I think there‚Äôs a valid case to be made for sidenotes. They‚Äôve been around in print media for centuries. A better separation in the representation of main content and details can be useful in many areas. I think especially long form educational and journalistic content could benefit a lot from sidenotes.</p>\n<p>My solution is the result of several iterations with help from <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57272564/what-html-element-for-semantic-sidenotes/57304727#57304727\">StackOverflow</a> users. They did mention elements I hadn‚Äôt considered, but there‚Äôs no perfect solution just yet.</p>\n<p>So when I found out about the <span><br /><span title=\"It's [like a survey](https://webwewant.fyi/about/) for web devs to tell browser makers what they want.

The HTML looks like this:\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n\n\n\n\n Some sentence with aspan class=\"sidenote sidenote--collapsed\">\n   class=\"sidenote sidenote--collapsed\">\n    \n      class=\"sidenote__button\"\n      tabindex=\"0\"\n      title=\"Here's the content of the sidenote.\"\n      onKeypress=\"handleSidenoteKeypress(event)\"\n      onClick=\"handleSidenoteButtonClick(event)\">\n        label\n      \n     class=\"sidenote__content\">\n       class=\"sidenote__content-parenthesis\">\n        (sidenote:\n      \n      Here's the content of the sidenote\n       class=\"sidenote__content-parenthesis\">\n        )\n      \n    \n  \nfor the sidenote.\n\n\nI wrap the whole thing in a span, \nmainly\n\n (sidenote: \n\n    As a nice side effect, on large screens, where the sidenote appears next to the body text, both asterisks get hover styling when one either the content or the inline span has the mouse cursor over it.\n)\n\n\n\n to keep the required JavaScript simple.\nThen there‚Äôs the inline phrase that gets the asterisk. The  tag would be perfect for it, but buttons are hidden by Safari and Firefox‚Äôs reader modes, leaving a gap in the sentence. With tabindex=\"0\" and some CSS, the thing seems to behave pretty much like a button. It has a title attribute, so the content is also shown on mouse hover.\nFor the sidenote content I use the  element. MDN says it was made for representing side comments and small print. So semantically that‚Äôs pretty good. It has an additional benefit: by default it should be rendered with a smaller font size. So even when CSS is not applied, like in my RSS reader, it should appear smaller.\nThe spans with the class sidenote__content-parenthesis are hidden with CSS. They‚Äôre mainly there for screen readers. I found that when my iPhone reads my posts out loud, only adding parenthesis around the sidenotes is confusing. By adding the phrase ‚Äòsidenote: ‚Äò, it‚Äôs much clearer why the sentence is interrupted.\nThe JavaScript I added is straightforward; it just toggles classes on the wrapper span sidenote:\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n\n\n\nfunction handleSidenoteButtonClick(e){\n  const el=e.target;\n  el.parentNode.classList.toggle('sidenote--expanded');\n  el.parentNode.classList.toggle('sidenote--collapsed');\n  el.blur();\n}\n\nfunction handleSidenoteKeypress(e){\n  if(e.key === 'Enter' || e.key === ' '){\n    const el=e.target;\n    e.preventDefault();\n    el.parentNode.classList.toggle('sidenote--expanded');\n    el.parentNode.classList.toggle('sidenote--collapsed');\n  };\n}\n\n\nThere‚Äôs a whole bunch of CSS to make the content appear in the right place, hide it by default on small screens and to add the asterisks. I‚Äôm not going to include all of it‚Äîuse the inspector of you‚Äôre interested. But it‚Äôs worth mentioning that just hiding the sidenote‚Äôs content with display: none causes it to be ignored by screen readers. So instead, I hide it like this:\n.sidenote--collapsed .sidenote__content,\n.sidenote__content-parenthesis{\n  position: absolute;\n  left: -99999px;\n  top: auto;\n}\nIs this solution good enough?\nThe solution above looks good in the major browsers; when CSS is applied things look as intended. When CSS is not available, default styles make the everything look as intended. In that scenario, the content in the example code above would look like this: ‚Äú(sidenote: Here‚Äôs the content of the sidenote)‚Äù. No weird line breaks there. The only screen reader test I did was with iOS. It speaks the text just as intended, including the ‚Äòsidenote:‚Äô part of it (which is the reason I included that part, otherwise the sentences sound weird).\nFor non-standard browsers, support is okay-ish. Firefox‚Äôs and Desktop Safari‚Äôs reader views do a fine job. It correctly renders the content within the  tags smaller. Same for The RSS reader I use, Reeder. Chrome‚Äôs \nexperimental\n\n (sidenote: \n\n    Jeez Chrome, how is this still experimental?!\n)\n\n\n\n reader mode adds some superfluous linebreaks, but doesn‚Äôt remove any content. Mobile Safari‚Äôs reader view hides the sidenote content, but the button span remains, so there‚Äôs still a readable main article. Pocket however, just hides the whole .sidenote span‚Äîweird!\nThe worst part of the solution is that requires CSS and JavaScript. There‚Äôs a lot of HTML. I guess it‚Äôs hard to add to CMSs. And it feels icky that the clickable part  has to be a .\nConclusion\nArguably, I (and you) would be better off, If I tried to write more concisely. But beyond this blog, I think there‚Äôs a valid case to be made for sidenotes. They‚Äôve been around in print media for centuries. A better separation in the representation of main content and details can be useful in many areas. I think especially long form educational and journalistic content could benefit a lot from sidenotes.\nMy solution is the result of several iterations with help from StackOverflow users. They did mention elements I hadn‚Äôt considered, but there‚Äôs no perfect solution just yet.\nSo when I found out about the \nWeb We Want\n\n (sidenote: \n\n    It‚Äôs like a survey for web devs to tell browser makers what they want. Check it out, there are cool ideas there.\n)\n\n\n\n, I submitted this sidenotes problem. The team selected it to be presented at the Beyond Tellerrand conference and asked me to make a video about how I made sidenotes (a short version of this post). Their team was formed by the browser makers, so I‚Äôm pretty sure the proper semantic solution really doesn‚Äôt exist yet.\nYou think my solution for sidenotes is not great? Neither do I. Vote for I want semantic HTML sidenotes and one day there may be a more elegant way to do this!"
