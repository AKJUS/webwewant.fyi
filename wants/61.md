Web maps and spatial data are the backbone of open data around the world. Governments promote spatial data infrastructure with the objective that everyone benefit equally. What has happened though is that huge companies have disproportionately leveraged this data to create centralized services that are available publicly (and for "free"), but at the cost of your privacy.

What we want is to make it easier to create and use web maps and spatial data by implementing maps in browsers. A native HTML `map` element could improve the map viewing experience on so many fronts, including privacy, accessibility, and progressive enhancement.

Our goal, and the goal of the [W3C Maps4HTML Community Group](https://www.w3.org/community/maps4html/) is to establish a standard method for web developers to include interactive web maps within HTML documents.
