Web maps are often seen as used only for store locator pages.  In this era of climate change and intelligent everything, maps could be so much more!  We think that integrating maps (and location) into HTML could be vital for a more private, more accessible society and world.

What we want in the Web is to make it easier to create and use web maps and spatial data by implementing maps in browsers. A native HTML `map` (or other, newer) element could improve the map viewing experience on so many fronts, including privacy, accessibility, performance and so on.

Our goal, and the goal of the [W3C Maps for HTML Community Group](https://www.w3.org/community/maps4html/) is to establish a standard method for web developers to include interactive web maps within HTML documents.
