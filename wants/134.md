I am working on an application to enable screen sharing, video capturing, and audio recording. The application enables user to switch from one media option to another when recording is in progress. The functionality is implemented via capturing media streams and rendering it on Canvas. Everything works fine as long as the tab is in focus.
 The moment the tab loses the focus or the browser window goes in background, the tab resources get throttled and functions like `requestAnimationFrame`, `setInterval`, etc. donâ€™t honor the requests.

The feature can be made declarative and implemented as a permission to continue execution of script and resource consumption in background.
 I believe this feature will open up many possibilities for a browser-based application and free end users from installing dozens of OS-specific applications.
