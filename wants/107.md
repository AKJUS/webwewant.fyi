Browsers support many locales when displaying input constraint validation error messages, but they display them based on `navigator.language`. A common request from clients is to have them in the language of the website in order to have a unified experience (especially if there are custom error messages displayed in the language of the website). This, currently, means re-creating them based on `input.validity`. That solution is not all that great as browsers give information to the user that is not available in `input.validity` (such as what is missing in the email format). I'd love to be able to specify the language that validation messages should use in some way.
