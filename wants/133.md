Fieldsets have horrible default styles by modern standards. Additionally, this default setup causes issues with using modern CSS (e.g., grid). How is a `fieldset` different than other semantic grouping element like `figure`, `aside`, `header`, `footer`, etc.? They should be a semantic way of grouping inputs and nothing else.
