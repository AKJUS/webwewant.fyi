As a Deaf designer, I design things for accessibility and consider myself an end user as well. When playing videos across the web, I constantly come across captions that are unintentionally covering other crucial information in videos. I want to drag my captions anywhere in the video, reposition the width / height of captions and even have captions pop out of the video itself so I can easily drag them next to the video when necessary. An example scenario: crucial info is lost in county / state / national emergency announcement videos, where they often use lower-thirds to communicate vital emergency or evacuation info- but the info is obscured by captions that cannot be repositioned or otherwise adjusted by the viewer. Another example: with different caption tracks for different speakers, individual caption tracks can be easily positioned next to each speaker to clarify who is speaking.
