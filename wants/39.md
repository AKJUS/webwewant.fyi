Ads are an important part of the web, but there is currently no way to describe them meaningfully in HTML. The spec suggests using the `aside` element, but that's not quite right, is it? For one thing, an `aside` is meant for tangential content, but ads are often the focus of a page. There should be a way to wrap arbitrary elements (not just banner ads, but sponsored articles and videos) in a descriptive tag that lets visitors and indexers know the purpose of the content.

A corollary to this is that in order for it to be valuable, search engines and browsers would have to reward the use of the `ad` element by giving preference to sites that used it correctly, the same way they already reward the use of other semantic tags to describe a page.
