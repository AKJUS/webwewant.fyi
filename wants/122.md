Service workers can be complicated to deal with and can easily break your site if you aren't careful. In an environment where multiple teams work on different parts of a website (ownership at the path level), it's hard to have both global functionality from a service worker (offline screen, notifications etc.) and have application logic per path because only one service worker can be active. Either everyone contributes to one service worker and can unintentionally break each otherâ€™s work, or each team has to duplicate the core functionality for their route. We don't have a good solution now but if a global service worker can match when a narrower scoped service worker fails to match then this could be easier to manage.
