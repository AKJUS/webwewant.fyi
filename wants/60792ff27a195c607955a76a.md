Currently, Edge has a dark mode applied to the browser but doesn't affect any websites. If the website offers any dark mode - light mode switch, it is fine. But for other websites which are very bright, it is an issue. There are a few extensions which take care of forcing dark mode automatically, but having native support in browser is much preferred.
