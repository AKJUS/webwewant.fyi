Normally the browser paints things on the screen as soon as they are ready. It often results in visual junk when the page consists of multiple components that have their own rendering lifecycle. I would like to have an ability to control when certain elements should be painted. Ideally I should be able to specify what ares of the screen should be updated together and what areas of the screen can be updated separately.
