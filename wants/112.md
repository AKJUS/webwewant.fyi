Right now the best way I know of to listen for the virtual keyboard is to listen to focus/blur or window resize events. This is hacky and unreliable. I would prefer to listen explicitly for onKeyboardUp, onKeyboardDown, and onKeyboardResize, and the event object should include the dimensions of the keyboard. 

This limitation causes problems if you are trying to pin an input to the bottom of the screen or if the screen does not support scrolling. The browser will attempt to scroll the input into view and if it canâ€™t, the keyboard will cover the input. Listening for keyboard events would allow for this to be handled more easily.
