We can control text overflow on one single line with `white-space: nowrap` and `text-overflow: ellipsis`, but thereâ€™s nothing for multi-line control. Apple introduced two proprietary properties (`-webkit-line-clamp` and `-webkit-box-orient`) for this and there are certainly ways to accomplish this goal with JavaScript, but a declarative, standardized way to control this in CSS would be most welcome.
