I like my blog posts with sidenotes. By sidenote, I am thinking of text thatâ€™s not independent enough from the main text to rate as an `aside`. For example: clarifications of words that I think most of my readers will know or personal stuff that I want to add, but keep from the main story. They're like footnotes, except that on the web, that's a bit of a typographic archaism.

I put the sidenotes in the margin of my text column. On small windows, I hide them. An underlined, clickable, link-like `span` allows the user to make them appear. I have [a workaround](https://stackoverflow.com/a/57304727/1171638), but it's not 100% accessible and requires funky HTML, CSS and JS to work.
