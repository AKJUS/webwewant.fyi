When I'm a user, I just want to read the page, darnit! I don't want things popping in front of my face asking me to subscribe to notifications or email lists. Most importantly, I don't want to wait while ads load; or even worse, see the text all move around once the ads load. (And, while we're at it, let's disable all automatically playing videos and sounds.)

This, by the way, is why so many people use adblockers!

At this point, I think we need more strictly delineate pages for reading, versus web applications. There should be some friction before an application can consume lots of bandwidth, generate sound, nag me, etc.
