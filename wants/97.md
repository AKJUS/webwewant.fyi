All operating systems give users the ability to sync their contacts and calendars.  Windows/iOS/Android all give native apps Calendar APIs to query the user's calendar to retrieve appointments and also an API to create new appointments.

I have built a calendar app as a PWA that only shows fake data in the browser.  In a native hybrid container app it will cross the bridge to native to retrieve real appointments and return those.  This is painful and only allows me to ship my app in the app stores, not in the open web.

I could ask my users to oAuth into their calendar services, but then I have to write handlers for each calendar service and the user experience isn't great (asking them to log in to calendar providers when they've already got their calendars syncing to their OS).

Much like thereâ€™s a forthcoming Contacts API, I think we need a Calendar API.
