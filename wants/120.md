Managing media is a problem I face regularly. Itâ€™s easy for their size to get out of control and while some tools will identify unoptimized media, it would be really nice to be able to optimize the media right from within the browser DevTools. There are third party services that enable this, but they also charge for their services and I have to do the work over the network instead of locally.
