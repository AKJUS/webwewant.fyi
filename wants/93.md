In many native platforms, there is a special “overscroll” effect that looks like a fluid colored shadow when the user reaches the end of a scrollable list (for example) and tries to scroll further. On the web this effect is applied only if scroll is applied to the `html` element. In web apps it's a common practice to have scroll on inner elements, so it would be nice if we could use this effect on inner scrollable elements as well.
