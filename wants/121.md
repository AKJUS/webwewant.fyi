One of the big challenges with web components is how to make them accessible. We can use some ARIA features to expose the `role` or state of component pieces, but we are currently unable to create explicit connections that rely on `id` references. That means we cannot connect web components parts to the page within which they are used nor can we connect pieces of two separate components across their boundaries. We need to fix this to build truly accessible component systems.
