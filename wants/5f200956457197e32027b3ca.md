On my project, the designers have made the specifications of our lists (`ul` and `ol`) quite stylized, with the list item icons distanced just a bit further from the list item content than is the default. Achieving this design is not possible with `list-style-image`, so I need to set their style to none and use `::before` instead for this effect, which also [has its drawbacks](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/list-style-type#Accessibility_concerns).

It would be great if we could adjust the offset of `list-style-image` so as not to have to resort to hacks.
