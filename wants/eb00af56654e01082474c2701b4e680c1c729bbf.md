With more and more OSes offering “night mode”—where the screen dims and blues are reduced—it would be nice to have a media query to detect that. Maybe even with a way to (request to) deactivate it for a site or a specific part of a website where color accuracy is important.

This would be interesting for media browsing or editing, but also for smaller stuff like adapting the site’s contrast like you might with `light-level` and `prefers-contrast: low` media queries.
