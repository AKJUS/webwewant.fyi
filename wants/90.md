There are a few different proprietary mechanisms for controlling the appearance of scrollbars, but we don't yet have a standardized approach to doing this yet. In particular, this solution should enable designers to control

* whether a scrollbar is shown on a given axis;
* the ways in which a scrollbar appears, such as whether it is visible, hidden, or hidden until scrolled or moused into; and
* the appearance of the various components of the scrollbar, such as the slider, the track, start and stop arrows, etc.
