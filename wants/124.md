Creating an appealing and interactive UI/UX can be tedious, especially with constrained budgets or in personal projects where you cannot hire a designer. I want to have an intelligent devtool that will measure the readability, visual appeal, and do things like color/image matching for me using data from other designs. Iâ€™d like it to suggest fonts, colors, and other design tweaks. The design database could even be collaborative like [Adobe Color](https://color.adobe.com/) (formerly Kuler).
