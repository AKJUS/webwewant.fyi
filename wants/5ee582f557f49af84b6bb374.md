Many web applications allow untrusted users to upload HTML. They often do this using a rich text editor. Then, they show this HTML to other users. Email applications like Gmail are like this. However, displaying user-generated HTML is challenging from a security point of view. Sometimes you can sanitize it on the server. Sometimes you can sanitize it on the client using something like [DOMPurify](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dompurify). However, no matter how you do it, itâ€™s a hard problem.

It'd be great if browsers could do this for us since they know how to do it best.
