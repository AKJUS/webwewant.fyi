I don't want the developer tools to automatically switch between being rows to columns based on their widthâ€”I want to be able to manually trigger that. Currently I keep my devtools at the width where they stay rows (since rows are better for my work flow, but sometimes I need more width).

I also want the ability to have the console drawer open as a column or a row. Currently all browsers have it split as a row.

Here are [some images for further clarification](https://imgur.com/a/AmDhCty).
