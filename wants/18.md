I hate fixed elements. They might be useful in very specific use cases, but the majority of the world abuses it and makes using the web impossible. I spend more time "cleaning up" a site with sticky elements than I do reading the site. I would appreciate the ability to remove this value as a part of my browserâ€™s preferences.
