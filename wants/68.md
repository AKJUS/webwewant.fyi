So imagine this: you enter DevTools, pick one item, for example a `div` that acts like a button, so it holds an icon, a label, some styling—you know, a background color, shadow, simple stuff. Then I simply right click that and press something like "Render separately" and it opens a new tab or a window and I see just this element, in isolation. It has everything inside, the icon, the label, the styling, but there's nothing more, just white background around it. It would be even cooler if I could quickly screenshot it in some visually appealing way, straight to my clipboard.
