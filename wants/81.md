The idea of boookmarking/installing a website is pretty confusing for most users. Instead of teaching users how to use bookmark/install in their browsers we should add an "install" protocol for URLs (like `tel:`, `sms:`, etc.). 
This way developers can add a link to their site, with `href="install:yourwebsite.com"` (or similar) - and if the users clicks on it the page will be bookmarked/installed (if the browser supports it), or the browser will ask what app to use (similar to what they do with `tel:` now if you click it in a desktop browser with no app available to handle `tel:` links).

As a next step, marketing could use these as well, adding "install:yourwebsite.com" to their ads and other marketing materials to make it obvious that the website can be installed like a "native app".
