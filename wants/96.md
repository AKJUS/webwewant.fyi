Forms are complicated. They can have multiple issues, depending on how to structure them. My want consists of the following:

- Implement HTML5 form elements in an accessible way. All built-in date or number pickers should be keyboard friendly and just work for developers.
- Allow developers to style those elements. The most common cause of inaccessible forms is to make them look “custom”. Allow that fully and make it easy.
- Allow *users* to fall back to “unstyled” form controls on request. Developers will implement inaccessible colors when they got full control over how they look. Users should always be able to fall back to the default, accessible look.

In addition, I’d like to see easier, less error prone ways to define a form field:

```html
<formfield type="text"
           value=""
           label="Your Name"
           name="name">
```

would create a properly labeled text field. No need for developers to create IDs, no opportunity for typos. And if a browser doen’t support it yet, it’s relatively easy to polyfill, too.
