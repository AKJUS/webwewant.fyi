Certain HTML structural elements: `main`, `nav`, `header` (in `body` scope), `footer` (in `body` scope), `aside`, `form` (with accessible label), and `section` (with accessible label) can be used to organize the content of a web page or web app into landmark regions. If you are a screen reader user, you can take advantage of a well-structured page by using keyboard shortcuts to navigate directly to landmark content. This is more efficient in terms of the number of keystrokes (i.e., it may have taken many tab key presses to move focus to the same place). Landmarks also give screen reader users a high-level overview of the page content.

However, if you are not a screen reader user, you cannot take advantage of this capability. In fact, you won't even know those landmarks are there (unless you install a browser extension).

I have opened or commented on requests to have landmark navigation for all users added to each of the mainstream browsers:

- Firefox: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=670928#c70
- Chrome/Edge: https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=704698#c23
- Safari: https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=172817#c2

I think this would be a really useful feature that would improve the web experience for anyone who uses a keyboard.
