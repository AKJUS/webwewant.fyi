`MediaRecorder` is currently specified to stop recording if a `MediaStreamTrack` is removed from the `MediaStream` being recorded. It should be possible to add and remove tracks from the `MediaStream` without `MediaRecorder` stopping. The solution can be both allowing tracks to be added or removed when `MediaRecorder` is paused and implementing WebRTCâ€™s `RTCRtpSender.replaceTrack()` for MediaRecorder.
