QR codes are very common and have been steadily increasing in usage as people move to no-touch systems.  It's also one of the few safe and widely compatible ways for the web to interact with objects.  While we have ways to read QR codes (shape detector) we don't have easy ways to generate them.  Generating QR codes is very complex and existing libraries are big. For such a common element I think it makes sense to have an HTML element that could display common types of visual codes including different types of barcode, QR codes and others similarly to an image tag.

In addition to reducing developer complexity. This could make applications smaller as they would not need to have large QR code libraries, or embed images.  However, like with `video` elements we could fall back all the way to an image if the desired visual code type is not supported.

User Agents could also improve accessibility by making it easy to full-screen the code, increase screen brightness when a user interacts with it or support things like right-click to copy the contents.
