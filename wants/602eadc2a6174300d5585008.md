CBOR is a standardized binary structured data format, akin to JSON, with additional benefits:

* Efficient storage of binary and numeric data types
* Data types such as Date can be stored directly
* Extensible with future data types, while maintaining backwards compatibility (https://www.iana.org/assignments/cbor-tags/cbor-tags.xhtml)
* It's inherently streamable (similar to [NDJSON](http://ndjson.org) in that it's easy to skim a stream of objects as there is no top-level enclosure)

CBOR was first published in RFC7049 in 2013.  Some editorial improvements have been made, with the current standard published at [RFC8949](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8949.html)

The format is well supported, with implementations in most all commonly used languages:  http://cbor.io/impls.html

Use cases include:

* Encoding binary file data inside a structured object for API-like calls without base64-encoding the payload or cross-referencing multipart MIME.  (There are a handful of questions per-day on Stack Overflow about base64 encoding file data so that a file upload can be kept in context of an object being sent to a server.  This is horribly inefficient.)
* Encoding/decoding all of the data types modern JavaScript engines support, including typed arrays.
* Efficient and extensible web tokens with [CWT](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8392)

Currently, we can work around the problem by loading a CBOR JavaScript library to encode/decode.  However, I believe a native implementation would have performance improvements.  At a minimum, we wouldn't need to load a library.

I propose that a standard CBOR encoder/decoder be implemented, with support for all of the datatypes supported by JavaScript.

The ubiquitous availability of JSON is what made JSON a popular choice.  CBOR's benefits make it better choice for most applications.  If CBOR were natively available, I have no doubt that it would be used much more broadly.
