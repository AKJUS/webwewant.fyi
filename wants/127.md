There are websites that contain scripts which detect when the user opens DevTools, and alter how the site works when that happens, usually to prevent any kind of deeper inspection. In order to counter malicious scripts such as these, it would be useful to be able to have an undetectable mode for the DevTools. Maybe some functions wouldn't be available, but hopefully it would work well enough to be able to inspect the website and bypass malicious scripts.
