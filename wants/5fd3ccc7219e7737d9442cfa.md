With the proliferation of Flexbox and Grid layout, it is imperative, accessibility wise, to be able to control tab order via CSS.

We already have a property that does this - `nav-index` - that died an untimely death and is only supported by Opera (as far as I know) right now.

Currently, `tabindex` attribute is completely inadequate to handle responsive layout, and the if you need one element to be the first in tab order, you cannot do it because the default `tabindex` is 0, and any negative value makes the element inaccessible.

And the alternative of assigning a `tabindex` for every other focusable element on the page is a ridiculous proposition.

Having `nav-index` also enables focus trapping with pure CSS:

```css
* {nav-index:1}
dialog * {nav-index:2}
dialog > :first-child:not(:focus) {nav-index:0}
```
