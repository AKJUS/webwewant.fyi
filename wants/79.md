Browser emulators donâ€™t do a great job emulating mobile devices (especially iOS). This makes debugging interactions painful. Generally, Android devices react the same way as what you get on a browser emulator however, but iOS devices are difficult to debug through the browser emulator and when connecting an iOS device directly to the computer. You end up going through thousands of lines of code in the source because the 'Inspect Element' cursor isn't available to select the element you want to debug.
