My wish would be for each screen reader to have a speech viewer tool that can be used by sighted designers and developers to debug their work. They would be able to use it like WAVE or Axe to preview how a screen reader would interpret what theyâ€™ve built. Like WAVE, it could have icons to show what each component does and syntax coloring to show errors.

Screen readers should not be a mystery to your average website builder.
