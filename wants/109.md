On some websites, it’s difficult to know when you are viewing a horizontally-scrollable element if the horizontal scrollbar appears below the bottom edge of the viewport. It would be nice if browsers could affix the scrollbar to the bottom edge of the viewport while the scrollable element’s own bottom edge is out of view. It could snap to the bottom of the element when that bottom edge is revealed (sort of like `position: sticky`, but in reverse).
