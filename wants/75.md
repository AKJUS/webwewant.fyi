Currently, `text-transform: uppercase` turns the german ß into double S (SS), which was the official rule and therefore the correct behaviour for most of the time. However, since 2017 [the capital sharp s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_%E1%BA%9E) is part of the official German orthography, and a lot of type designers are including the new glyph in their typefaces (Unicode `U+1E9E`). 

Unfortunately there is no real workaround, besides hardcoding the capital sharp s into your markup, which is not always a practical solution.
I believe, `text-transform: uppercase` should check first if `U+1E9E` is available in the font and in this case make use of it. If there is no capital sharp s, the ß would be transformed into double S, according to the old rule.
