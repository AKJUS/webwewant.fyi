Web apps try to keep feature parity with native apps and this is very good. Local file access, USB device access, network access, and control over camera and microphone are great features, but may be abused by rogue site. That could, in turn, ruin the whole web ecosystem.

Origin trials and tokens are not sufficient mechanisms against rogue players because they may pretend to be good guys to obtain tokens and change the code after that at any time for particular user. If some app wants to get any of sensitive privileges there should be some mechanism for reviewing the code and auditing submitted changes to ensure the site has not gone rogue after its initial approval.
