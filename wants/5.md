Currently, there is no mechanism for one-way encapsulation of styles. In other words, enabling global styles to apply to a portion of a web page, but not allow the styles applied to that portion to bubble up into the page as a whole. Scoped styles, [as they were originally conceived](http://html5doctor.com/the-scoped-attribute/), would have solved this, but they seem to have been abandoned in favor of the 2-way encapsulation of the [Shadow DOM](https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#shadow-trees) (no styles "leak" into the component, no styles "leak" out). The Shadow DOM also has a dependency on JavaScript, which should not be necessary for accomplishing style scoping. An alternate proposal, CSS `@scope` rules has not really progressed since [the initial working draft in 2014](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-scoping-1/).

We need to solve this.
