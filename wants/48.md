The Web is around 30 years old and building good forms is still hard to do. Cross device compatible date picker? Time picker? Number only value? Dropdown with values that are fetched from server? What about huge dropdowns? They should have filter option to narrow down all the options. 

These are all basic elements that get built frequently and should be in HTML out of the box so that developers don't have to re-invent the same form component every time they build a website.
