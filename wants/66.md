`MutationObserver` is great. I use it, together with `Node.matches()`, to initialize components; `DOMContentLoaded` is now a thing of the past. It doesn't matter when or how new content gets inserted into a document, `MutationObserver` is gonna be there, handling any post-processing. Now, as nice as this sounds, there is one thing that really sucks about `MutationObserver`: it will not fire for nodes that are being inserted/created via `innerHTML`; only the outermost mutation will be seen and fire the event. This means that everytime `MutationObserver` fires, we have to query for nodes inside the target node and we need to track its children so we can then initialize all the new ones. Here’s [an example](https://schepp.github.io/native-browser-apis/#/0/49); it’s super cumbersome! Updating `MutationObserver` with the ability to see nodes inserted via `innerHTML` would help considerably.
