The `picture` element lets you provide different images to the user based on a media query attached to a `source` element. It's a great way to save user bandwidth when your image differs at different viewports (for example, serving a wide image on desktop and a square one on mobile). However, attaching a media query to a `video` `source` does not do the same thing, it just plays whichever `source` is specified first. We are using muted, autoplay videos more and more and right now we have to render an empty `div` tag then fill with a `video` via JavaScript after page load. 

Hereâ€™s [an example published from the <cite>New York Times</cite>](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/07/22/us/politics/elizabeth-warren-selfies.html) and [another on Glitch](https://efficient-raincoat.glitch.me/).

It would be amazing to not have to script this at all and just let the `video` element work it out for us.
