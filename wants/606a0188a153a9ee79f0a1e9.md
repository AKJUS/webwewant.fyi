I have developed HTML-based report generation library. Some documents always need to be printed in landscape mode, others have portrait style. For Internet Explorer, we apply third party tool that can internally change print template to landscape before print and/or preview document by inserting some ActiveX component into the HTML layout. It would be great if such functionality have been embedded in the browser already, maybe through some API.
