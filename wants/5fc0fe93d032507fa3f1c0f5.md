When you browse a web page, there should always be a permalink (e.g., a small chain icon) appearing near each heading element (`h1`â€“`h6`) when you mouse-over them. This would enable you to share a direct link to that particular section. When clicking that permalink, the page URL should be directly changed to that DOM element using a dynamic fragment identifier (e.g., "BASE_URL#The-sub-title-2") and scroll the actual page content to make this particular header move to the top of the viewport.

[Well-formatted GitHub README files](https://github.com/WebWeWant/webwewant.fyi/blob/main/README.md) do this nicely.
