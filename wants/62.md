Currently DevTools will show the affecting line in stylesheets for property explicitly declared in a stylesheet. However, if some property is not declared and is computed based on its children (e.g., height) or is a cascaded or inherited property, DevTools simply shows the resulting value. It would be great to be able to get more insight into how these values are influenced or calcualated.
