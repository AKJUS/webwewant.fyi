Live in-browser debugging often requires trial and error. The current DevTools don't allow tracing *backwards*, so sometimes you have to reproduce the problematic scenario over and over, which could be tricky, especially if it's a flaky race condition. It would be great to have a possibility to dump the current debugger state to a file, so you can restore it later and start from the same place.

Note: I previously [submitted a "broader" want](/wants/53), but this is perhaps the most important aspect of that.
