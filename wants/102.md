Many modern websites use sticky header navigation, which doesn't play nicely with native HTML anchor navigation that scrolls to an element with the DOM `id` referenced in the URL fragment.  [This example](https://codepen.io/anthumchris/full/vYYPYwj) shows how content is hidden after an anchor navigation.

The current workaround is to use JS to adjust scroll position, or to add `padding-top` to the element we're navigating to, which doesn't always flow nicely.  Native HTML anchor navigation was very useful in the past and could still offer powerful native scrolling today if we could make the anchoring system aware of elements affixed to the top of the screen.
