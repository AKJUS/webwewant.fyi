Since a screen reader, for example, presents the page to a user based on source order, a layout that visually shuffles the order can fail a WCAG review under 1.3.2: Meaningful Sequence and potentially 1.3.1: Info and Relationships. Flex, grid, floats, and absolute positioning can all do this (along with some table trickery). Interactive controls can be easily tested by tabbing, and tools like Microsoftâ€™s Accessibility Insights already show tab order, but non-interactive content is harder to test easily, and harder to present to stakeholders in a meaningful way.

I filed [a feature request with Firefox](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1415410) and [another with Accessibility Insights](https://github.com/Microsoft/accessibility-insights-web/issues/394). I also created [a bookmarklet that will show you the source order](http://adrianroselli.com/2019/04/reading-order-bookmarklet.html) (and another bookmarklet to go along with it that animates the sequence in case you want to visualize it hands-free).
