In other media, we have the ability to define content regions within a layout and flow content from one region into the next in a specific order. We don’t have this capability on the web currently. In order to achieve anything close to what’s possible in print layout tools, we either have to involve JavaScript or we must manually break our content into sections and hope we’ve allocated enough space for each of the blocks.
