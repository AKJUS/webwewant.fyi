In the current implementation of `box-shadow`, the blur is pretty linear. In other words, the drop in transparency happens in linear steps from the specific color to transparent. If we were able to set a cubic bezier curve to control the steps in transparency of the blur, then we would be able to create nicer and more realistic looking drop shadows.
