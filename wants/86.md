Currently when using web components and `shadowRoot`, any element within the `shadowRoot` will not be noticed by, say a screen readers, or even a form (for example when doing a form `input`).
 There is an effort to come up with a solution to the form part, but that would not automatically solve the assistive technology part.
 It would be awesome to be able to add some ARIA/`role` attributes to the component tag or identify elements that should be exposed within the `shadowRoot` to make the the component accessible.
