Currently if you want to add spacing between two lines, you need to use `line-height.` This property has the annoying effect of always adding an amount of spacing above and below the block of text.

Iâ€™d suggest something like `line-spacing` that would, instead, specify how much spacing should be added between lines only. No padding would be added at the bottom and top of the block of text.
