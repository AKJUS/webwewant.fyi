Several web services (requiring some form of payment and/or end-user agreement) offer SSML parsing, including Amazon Alexa, IBM Watson Bluemix, and Google Actions. SSML parsing should be open source and free, without requiring payment and/or EUA/licensing.

I am currently using [my own code](https://github.com/guest271314/SpeechSynthesisSSMLParser), which parses several—though not all—of the SSML elements and attributes described in [the SSML spec](https://www.w3.org/TR/2010/REC-speech-synthesis11-20100907/). The implementation, when completed, should be extensible, capable of being adjusted for future development of speech synthesis technologies.
