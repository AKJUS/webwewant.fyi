With COVID-19, a growing number of “contactless” solutions are being brought to market quickly.  Barcodes, QR codes, and similar solutions are a cheap and easy to build, but require one thing: a bright screen. I want a screen brightness API such that *only when an app is visible/active* (to avoid abuse) it can maximize screen brightness for a scanner to read something on the screen, then return to regular brightness. With this API, ticketing, payments, and other ID scenarios can be quickly built out and *used* without the need for a long-term installed app or without the ceremony of darker screens and the speed decrease that brings to lines and queues at serving lines and events.
