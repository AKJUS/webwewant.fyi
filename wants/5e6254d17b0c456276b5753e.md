Imagine with me your sites API calls are returning 401's. Imagine the data feed for your charts is now a SaaS and is no longer free and your site is pulling in 404's. Imagine the SaaS software you pay for only displays a 500 error for two days.

I want the browser to actually notify the user that their User Experience may not be what the developer has intended.

I also want the browser to notify the team who is managing the site by creating a issue ticket for the user experience fail in the search console.

How is lack of this impacting your work? Most SaaS software is coded on contract and once live the contract ends. There is no one on the help desk of the software that can fix the bad user experience that back end data feeds cause, there is also no way for the company to get a developer to go fix it without an entire new contract being drawn up.

How do you currently work around this limitation? I advise the users of the Coding Errors and tell them their is nothing they or I can do about it but to convince management to switch to some other vendors SaaS.
