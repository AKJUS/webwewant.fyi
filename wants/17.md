In some browsers, clicking on an anchor that links to a form field on the same page does not give the field full focus, meaning you can't start typing right away. Via keyboard, users must tab away and tab back to be able to input content into the field. Overcoming this limitation requires JavaScript, but that isnâ€™t reliable, so it would be great to have the behavior standardized across all browsers.
