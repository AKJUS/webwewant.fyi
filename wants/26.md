After transpilation, minification, and with flaky source map support in many places (e.g., rollbar downloads new source maps after the first error, and doesn't apply them retroacively to the stack trace), a lot of information about errors is lost. Combine this with ubiquitous async programming, and all you get is something like "a.x is undefined", which hardly actionable.

I’d like to see instrumentation of functions (like rollbar does in python) where you can see the function's local variables and arguments alongside the stack trace. I’d also like to see async traces, which trace the scopes where a Promise was created, fulfilled, rejected, and awaited. These are huge omissions in JavaScript tooling today.
