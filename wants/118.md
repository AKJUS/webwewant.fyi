Letâ€™s be honest, the web is largely vertical. That sucks. Sometimes you want to do something a bit different and you design something to scroll horizontally in your page and seems fine until you try to scroll the thing with a mouse and the only way is to awkwardly drag the scrollbar. Then you write some JavaScript and feel dirty inside ;-)

What if we could define the scroll direction for an element? Maybe something like this:

```css
div {
  scroll-orientation: horizontal;
}
```
