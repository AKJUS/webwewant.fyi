There are guidelines scattered throughout the web about readability best practices when considering typography in web design. I want a tool that can assess a combination of the following:

* font size
* paragraph length/width, and
* line-height.

A tool like this could help ensure that content on a website is designed in a way to ensure the readability experience is optimal for users.
