If you are building toggles (or similar interfaces) you often need to make adjustments to an element’s `display` property. Often this requires tracking the element’s initial CSS `display` value before setting it to "none" so you can switch it back later. It would be nice to have a mechanism by which you could reset an element’s `display` property (and potentially other properties) without having to know what the original setting was.
