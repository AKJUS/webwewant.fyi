Icons and other glyph-like symbols appear most consistent with adjacent text when they are aligned with that text's typographic median (meaning half its cap height… some type references conflate median with x-height). There is currently no `vertical-align` property that easily accomplishes this: Many projects instead use `vertical-align: middle` and then push or pull the icon up or down a pixel or two using `top`, `translate` or `margin` to account for the difference.It would be nice to have an explicit `vertical-align: text-middle` property.

Here’s [an example of what that could look like](https://cloudfour.com/thinks/some-imaginary-css/#align-to-typeface-median).
