In e-commerce it's pretty standard to filter products based on price, both minimum and maximum. Currently we need to reside to JavaScript to build a bar with two handles to set those values. It would be great if this could be done in a native manner. I reckon that having the option to make an `input[type="range"]` have two handles to set both minimum and maximum values would have use cases beyond what I stated above.
