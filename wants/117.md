You can reference one `datalist` from multiple `input` elements, which is highly convenient.  It would also be highly convenient to enhance `select` to reference a `datalist` (or `selectlist` or whatever), so that multiple `select` tags could reference the same collection of options, rather than repeating the same list of options multiple times.

[Someone also asked about this on StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/49750135/why-does-the-select-tag-not-work-with-a-datalist-tag).
