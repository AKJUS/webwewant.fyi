Currently, when I use CSS Scroll Snap Points, there are a few shortcomings which I'd like to see addressed. They all center around programmatically interacting with them:

1. I'd love to have `.start()`, `.previous(snapCount)`, `.next(snapCount)`, and `.end()` methods to move them around (e.g., when people click on arrow buttons, tap an arrow key on their keyboard, or when auto-sliding it). 
2. I'd like to have a snap event, once the element has snapped to a point, with info on which snap point of how many total snap points it just snapped to, so that I can update a progress indicator.
3. I'd like to see is the scroll event getting a new property which tells me if a scroll event was user-created or if it results from automatic scrolling (also interesting for the smooth scrolling coming from CSS scroll-behavior).
4. I'd love to see the problem of endless scrolling carousels solved somehow, maybe by something similar to what CSS `-moz-element` does, to be able to have a carousel/scroll snap element repeat its elements whenever its end has been reached.
