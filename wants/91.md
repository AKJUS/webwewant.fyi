In native applications UI it is common to use lines that have thickness of 1 physical pixel. With web technologies it is non-trivial to render such lines on screens with a pixel ratio of greater than 1. Safari does allow for fractional values (e.g., `border-width: 0.5px` for devicePixelRatio=2 and `border-width: 0.3333px` for devicePixelRatio=3).
 No other browsers support this though. Instead, we have to rely on hacks like `transform: scale(0.5)`.
