Browsers localize automatically quotation marks if a `lang` attribute is provided which is great, but we can do much more to enhance and simplify experience of developers but also authors on the web.

In French, exclamation and question mark both require a non-breaking space before them, on the contrary of English. Often, people on the web use normal space which create orphan sign at the end of a new line. 

Currently, developers aware of this problem solve it by:
- Replacing space characters before ! and ! in text with &nbsp; or \xa0
- Using white-space: nowrap; CSS property and adding an HTML element encompassing the last word and the sign ! or ? of a sentence
- Use no space
