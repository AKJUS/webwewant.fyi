It would be great if SVG elements that are animating specific properties could be offloaded to the GPU without having to try to force it by using tricks like `translateZ` or `willchange` like many people do. SVG usage is increasing year after year, so it would be helpful for performance if it received the same level of consideration given to animated HTML elements.

Note: I say this with full realization that there are many factors that underpin this issue.
