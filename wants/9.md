The `portal` element makes many common practices so much easier: posting to social media, integrating with 3rd party apps, and simplifying SPA pages. Since activating the `portal` element updates the URL, and Chrome Canary (the only browser with an implementation) doesn't add the old page to the history, once inside a portal the only way to go back is if the page implements a way to go back.
