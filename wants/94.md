Translating graphics is a pain. Currently if you want to use `img` elements with SVGs, you lose the ability to load external fonts inside of the SVG. You *can* embed the fonts in the CSS inside of the SVG but that means that the font is downloaded every time a SVG is requested. Allowing us to embed fonts in SVGs used in the `img` element would make the web a more accessible and multilingual-friendly page.
