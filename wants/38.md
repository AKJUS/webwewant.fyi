If people had to make an explicit choice to see ads or to be tracked and monetized (which could be controlled in the browser), we could make websites and applications based on a business model that preserves privacy and serves users, and get the advantage that should come with doing so, instead of having to compete with sites that prey on users ignorance of what they're giving up.
