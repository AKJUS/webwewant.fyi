To make the web more accessible, tech educators have been teaching about the importance of things like focus indicators and color contrast. A number of accessibility best practices could be automatically fixed by browsers, and this is what I'd like them to do (maybe under a not-via-script-detectable setting). For instance, lack of focus indication could be fixed by forcing a clear 10px outline, lack of readability because of low contrast text could be detected and fixed by adding a background with extra contrast to text nodes.

This impacts my work, but also that of many different users with disabilities. Current workaround is relying on authors to provide these things (and do the work convincing their colleagues of this need).
